Response list: ["I'm going to be moving from Warsaw to Ukraine to take Romania and I'm going to be bouncing them in the Black Sea."]
Ground truth: That's my intent; I was going to ask you to do the same but you beat me to it.

idx: 1
Response list: ["I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get them to talk to you, but I'm going to keep it open."]
Ground truth: Still though, you seem well placed!

idx: 2
Response list: ['I’m not sure how you’re doing with France either, but I’m not going to be a part of anything with you.']
Ground truth: Have you been talking to Russia much?

idx: 3
Response list: ["I'm not sure if you're going to Hol or not, but I'm going to give you a free pass into Belgium for an alliance against England."]
Ground truth: Are you aiming to claim Belgium in year 1? As it is, there's no way for you to get three builds so curious which two you will prioritize.

idx: 4
Response list: ["I'm not sure yet. I'm still waiting for the information from Austria."]
Ground truth: I don't really have a good read on Russia to be honest

idx: 5
Response list: ["I'm not interested in Norway either."]
Ground truth: So I'm guessing you plan on hitting the Germans then? Need help with that?

idx: 6
Response list: ["I'm not going to let you do that."]
Ground truth: Thanks for the heads up

idx: 7
Response list: ["I'm not sure yet. I'm going to wait for Italy to speak first."]

Ground truth: If you reeeally want to try a Lepanto, we can go for it lol, but I think we'd stall out a bit too much to make it worthwhile

idx: 9
Response list: ["I think you're right about Turkey."]
Ground truth: He’s scared of me pulling off a lepanto. What’s the deal for you guys, seems like you and england have an agreement at the very least to stay out of ENG. Did you and germany agree to that bounce in Bur?

idx: 10
Response list: ['I’m not sure if you’re going to do it, but I’ll try.']
Ground truth: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

idx: 11
Response list: ['I think I meant France or Austria?']
Ground truth: Am currently speaking to both but haven't really moved towards either as of yet.

Ground truth: Have you been talking to Russia much?

idx: 3
Response list: ["I'm not sure if you're going to Hol or not, but I'm going to give you a free pass into Belgium for an alliance against England."]
Ground truth: Are you aiming to claim Belgium in year 1? As it is, there's no way for you to get three builds so curious which two you will prioritize.

idx: 4

Ground truth: If you reeeally want to try a Lepanto, we can go for it lol, but I think we'd stall out a bit too much to make it worthwhile

idx: 9
Response list: ["I think you're right about Turkey."]
Ground truth: He’s scared of me pulling off a lepanto. What’s the deal for you guys, seems like you and england have an agreement at the very least to stay out of ENG. Did you and germany agree to that bounce in Bur?

idx: 10
Response list: ['I’m not sure if you’re going to do it, but I’ll try.']
Ground truth: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

idx: 11

Response list: ['I think he flipped them because he was getting too much from the east and wanted to get back to the west.']
Ground truth: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you

idx: 15
Response list: ['I’m not sure if you’re going to be friendly with me or not.']
