Ground truth: Have you been talking to Russia much?

Response list: ["I'm not sure if I'm going to Hol or not. I'm not sure if I'm going to get Belgium for an alliance against England."]
Ground truth: Are you aiming to claim Belgium in year 1? As it is, there's no way for you to get three builds so curious which two you will prioritize.

idx: 4
Response list: ["I haven't heard from Russia yet. I'm not sure about Austria."]
Ground truth: I don't really have a good read on Russia to be honest

Ground truth: Thanks for the heads up

I am not sure if I would be willing to commit to the west if they are.  I am not sure if I would be willing to commit to the south if they are.

Ground truth: All I have heard from Italy thus far is they don't want to fight so... hopefully that is the case

Response list: ["I'm not sure if I should be setting up a convoy to Tun or not, but I'm not sure if I should be opening to Tyn."]
Ground truth: If you reeeally want to try a Lepanto, we can go for it lol, but I think we'd stall out a bit too much to make it worthwhile

idx: 9
Response list: ["I think that's a good idea. I'm going to try to get the French to attack the Austro-Italian corridor."]
Ground truth: He’s scared of me pulling off a lepanto. What’s the deal for you guys, seems like you and england have an agreement at the very least to stay out of ENG. Did you and germany agree to that bounce in Bur?

idx: 10
Response list: ['I have no idea what you are talking about.']
Ground truth: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

idx: 11
Response list: ['I think I will ally with France.']
Ground truth: Am currently speaking to both but haven't really moved towards either as of yet.

What are your plans vis a vis alliances and expansion?

idx: 12
Response list: ["I'm not sure I'm ready to just hand over Norway and Sweden, unfortunately:"]
Ground truth: Sounds good to me! Thank you so much for being agreeable. I view Norway as a gesture of goodwill and I will definitely remember it. Hopefully, I will find another way to help you in the future 😃

idx: 13
Response list: ["I think I will move to Sevestapol in year 1. I'm not sure yet if I will move to St Petersburg, but I'm leaning towards not."]
Ground truth: Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North

idx: 14
Response list: ["I don't know, I just don't see it."]
Ground truth: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you
