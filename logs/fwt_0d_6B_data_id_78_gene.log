Instruction: In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.
Input: The former Liverpool and Stoke player, 32, has been a free agent since leaving Wigan at the end of last season.
"Because we have had a game every three days we haven't had enough training to test his quality precisely," Luzon told BBC London 94.9.
"He has a lot of experience. We will see and take a decision."
Pennant joined the Latics in February on a short-term deal and scored three goals in 13 outings as Wigan were relegated from the Championship.
The former Arsenal, Birmingham, Real Zaragoza and FC Pune City man was offered a new contract but decided to leave the DW Stadium.
Luzon has signed seven players so far this summer and could still strengthen his squad before the transfer window closes on Tuesday.
"We have time and if we have the chance, financially, to bring quality players to the squad, we will do it," he said.
Response list: ['Wigan Athletic have signed defender Luke Pennant from Leicester City.']
Ground truth: Charlton Athletic head coach Guy Luzon is considering offering a deal to winger Jermaine Pennant, who is currently training with the Addicks.

Instruction: In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.
Input: His "something for everyone" programme includes a musical version of Groundhog Day, an adaptation of Dr Seuss's The Lorax, Ibsen's The Master Builder starring Ralph Fiennes, and Pinter's The Caretaker with Timothy Spall.
The director of hit musical Matilda and acclaimed film Pride tells the BBC of his hopes for his first year in the job and what it's like taking over from Kevin Spacey.
What's the past year been like since you were announced as the Old Vic's new boss?
Having got the job and being told that it was going to start in summer 2015, within hours somebody from the Old Vic called me and said we need you to announce your first season in the new year.
Then we got into a discussion about that season being a whole year of work. Obviously, I wasn't walking round with a year's season in my head, so I had to scramble to do a lot of things very quickly.
It's been incredibly busy while tending to Matilda in the background and releasing Pride in the autumn as well, so it was full of exciting, breathtakingly hopeful moments and crushing disappointments when projects fell to pieces.
Your new season starts with a new play, Future Conditional by Tamsin Oglesby. How important is it to bring in new work?
It's a very important thing. The thing about choosing the first play is that it's ridiculously symbolic. I've had this play for a while. It's got so many people in it, it's been hard to find somewhere to do it.
It's political, funny and thought-provoking and has a big, strong youth aspect. It reflects so many of the things I care about.
What does it mean to you to be able to premiere Groundhog Day at the Old Vic?
I was developing it beforehand. We didn't know where it was going to go. I thought that what we were really making was an intelligent, mainstream Broadway musical, with a lot in common with The Music Man and Our Town as American fables.
It needs a large audience and a large stage, and I wanted to start it in this country, so it's the perfect match.
Do you feel extra pressure after your success with Matilda?
Making a new musical is a mountain to climb, and each time you say "That's the last one, I'm not going to do it anymore." They are hard enough to do without added expectations.
They're so hard that actually a lot of the time, you don't think about the audiences or critics. You think of something much more immediate, problems like the scene or the set.
You can't predict how much people will like it, but what we can do is make the story have integrity. It's absolutely possible it could be a flop.
If you're worried about whether something succeed or fails, then don't even start on it. You have to have a bigger reason for doing it.
What's your thinking behind your Â£10 preview ticket scheme?
What I'm interested in is removing the obstacle of affordability for people who think they might be inclined to try out theatre.
I'm not somebody who says that everybody has to love theatre, any more than everybody has to love football, but some people could form a really meaningful relationship with theatre and haven't because of the ticket price.
We've got to remove that. We've got make the experience feel less posh.
How do you think your approach will differ from Kevin Spacey's?
It will differ enormously in some respects and not at all in others. While he's been head of the building he's had an enormous number of people helping him, and those people are still here. So how the theatre functions is unchanged on many levels.
I'll be pretty much invisible. I'm a director - I like hiding behind other people.
But there will be glamour as well, because there will be a lot of star actors passing though the theatre.
[Kevin] could shake somebody's hand and get them to write a cheque. I can't do that, but they'll write a cheque for my ideas that I'm pitching or because Ralph Fiennes or Tim Spall is standing next to me.
It's funny because people used to to say: "How can a Hollywood actor run a theatre?" Last night people were asking if I was nervous about taking over from Kevin. It's like only Hollywood actors can run a theatre now!
The Old Vic's new season begins on 1 September.
Response list: ["The Old Vic's new director, David Spalding, has said he's excited about the first season of his new musical projects."]
Ground truth: Matthew Warchus has announced his first season as the new artistic director of London's Old Vic.

Instruction: In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.
Input: Sydney-based Michael Robotham won the British Gold Dagger award for his novel Life or Death.
Former journalist Mr Robotham defeated prominent writers including JK Rowling - writing as Robert Galbraith - and Stephen King for the honour.
Life or Death, his 10th novel, is the story of a prisoner who escapes shortly before he is due to be released.
Mr Robotham, who lives in Sydney, said he was grateful for the respect of his fellow writers.
"For all the fact that it's lovely to have commercial success, to sell lots of books, to be able to be a full-time writer, something like the Dagger makes you feel you have the respect of your peers and you are part of a long tradition of very fine writers," he said.
Mr Robotham said that many of the autobiographies he ghost-wrote while in Britain of "the great, the good and the less good" assisted him in his novel writing.
"I was very comfortable capturing the voice and making the characters live and breathe on the page and making them seem very real because I had written for so many real people over that 10-year period," he was quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald as saying.
One of his subjects was the imprisoned performer Rolf Harris who was jailed last year for 12 indecent assaults on four girls, one aged just seven or eight.
Mr Robotham said that he felt betrayed by Harris and "beat himself up enormously" about it.
He has become the second Australian to win a Gold Dagger, after Peter Temple for The Broken Shore in 2007.
Response list: ['Australian writer Michael Robotham has won the British Gold Dagger award for his novel Life or Death.']
Ground truth: An Australian writer has beaten stiff competition to win one of the world's most prestigious crime writing awards.

Input: Mr Obama said after the meeting that much of the discussion had focused on the upcoming climate conference in Paris.
Mr Modi added that the two sides had set "ambitious national agendas" to tackle climate change.
Experts say India's position is key if a climate change deal is to be signed in Paris later this year.
India is the world's third largest carbon emitter, after China and the US.
This is the fifth meeting between Mr Obama and Mr Modi since the latter swept to power in India in May 2014.
"What I indicated to the prime minister is that I really think that India's leadership in this upcoming conference will set the tone not just for today but for decades to come", Mr Obama said in a statement after the meeting.
Mr Modi's statement said that while both leaders shared "an uncompromising commitment on climate change", he was careful to mention that this was "without affecting our ability to meet the development aspirations of humanity".
India argues that more than 20% of its population has no access to electricity and they have a right to development.
Earlier this year, India's Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar told the BBC that India would not follow China's lead to announce a target year for its carbon emissions to peak.
However, Mr Modi reiterated his commitment to "clean and sustainable energy" and announced plans to include "not just a plan to add 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022, but a development strategy that will enable us to transition to a more sustainable energy mix".
The statement from the Indian side added that Mr Modi had sought US help to bring about "UN reform" under which India is seeking a permanent seat on the security council.
Response list: ['US President Barack Obama said India\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi would "set the tone" for the Paris climate talks.']
Ground truth: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met US President Barack Obama before concluding his visit to the country.

Input: The Scot triumphed at the WGC-HSBC Champions tournament in 2015 then won at the Travelers Championship in 2016.
But the world number 44 has not registered a top-10 finish in 2017.
"Maybe after last year being so incredible for me, it was inevitable there was going to be a slight downturn," Knox told BBC Scotland.
"I haven't played as well, but I don't feel any different, to be honest. I don't feel my game has dropped any.
"Golf's a funny old game as everybody knows; the line is so small between playing well and not playing well. Right now I'm just not getting the most out of my rounds.
"I'm hitting the ball well, I've maybe just got to take care of a few more putts and avoid the silly mistakes that creep in. I'm very optimistic that things are going to turn around very soon."
The 32-year-old is in Paris to compete in the European Tour's French Open at Le Golf National, which is also the venue for the 2018 Ryder Cup.
Inverness-born Knox narrowly missed out on selection for Team Europe in 2016 and is determined to do what it takes to be one of Thomas Bjorn's picks next year.
"It's exciting to come to Europe for a month," said Knox, who is normally based in Florida.
"I won't be playing the Irish Open because we're going to spend a week in Italy on holiday to keep my wife happy. I'm very much looking forward to this week and then the Scottish Open and the Open Championship. It would be great to peak for those events.
"It's obviously my goal to make the Ryder Cup team, and with Le Golf National being the venue for it, I thought it would be great to come and give it a go - the course looks really good.
"Just standing around at the 18th, it's a nice little area where you can see a bunch of holes and I can just imagine how good the atmosphere will be come Ryder Cup time because there will be so many people around those holes.
"They have a lot of water around them so there's going to be a lot of risk-reward, so I think it's going to be a fantastic venue."
Response list: ['Scott Knox has not played well in the last few weeks of the 2017-18 season, but he is still determined to be one of the top players in the Ryder Cup.']
Ground truth: Russell Knox believes playing in Europe over the next month can help him rediscover the form that won him two titles in a year.

Input: A total of 811,804 passengers used the airport last month, up 5.4% from 2016.
The number of international travellers rose by 13.6% in February, with Edinburgh now officially the UK's fastest-growing airport in terms of international passengers.
The airport said the benefits of its growth would extend outwith the hub.
Edinburgh Airport chief executive Gordon Dewar said: "Once again our passenger numbers have broken a new record.
"This is further proof that the airport is continuing to service the growing demand for what is without doubt one of Europe's leading cities.
"As we grow we deliver greater international connectivity for this city and for Scotland - and the benefits of our growth are felt well beyond this airport."
Response list: ['Edinburgh Airport has grown by 13.6% in February, with 811,804 international passengers arriving in the first month of the year.']
Ground truth: An increase in international traffic was a key factor in Edinburgh recording the busiest February ever at a Scottish airport.

Input: Campaign groups have condemned the election of the countries to the 47-seat Human Rights Council.
Human Rights Watch said some new members had denied access to UN monitors investigating alleged abuses.
The UN General Assembly elected a total of 14 new members to the Geneva-based council on Tuesday.
China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Algeria and Cuba won seats unopposed, but human rights groups have complained that they are the countries that the body should be censuring.
New York-based Human Rights Watch singled out five countries - China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Algeria - which have denied access to UN human rights monitors keen to investigate alleged abuses.
"Countries that haven't allowed UN experts appointed by the council to visit have a lot of explaining to do," said Peggy Hicks, the group's global advocacy director.
And UN Watch, a frequent critic of UN practices, also accused these countries, along with Algeria, of systematically violating the rights of their citizens.
The newly members will be on the council for three years from 2014. The body aims to shine a spotlight on rights abuses by adopting resolutions.
UN Watch made a broader criticism of the Human Rights Council, accusing it of repeatedly criticising Israel while failing to adopt a resolution that has been critical of China, Russia or Saudi Arabia.
The Human Rights Council was created in 2006 to replace the UN's widely discredited Human Rights Commission.
But the council has faced similar criticism to the commission, with the election of countries with questionable track records in human rights.
South Sudan and Uruguay failed to win seats in the competitive elections for their regional grouping on Tuesday. The other regions had uncontested votes.
Response list: ['The UN has selected 14 new members to the Human Rights Council, a body that has been accused of failing to hold Israel accountable for human rights abuses.']
Ground truth: China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Vietnam have been elected to the UN's human rights watchdog, despite concerns about their rights records.

Perry, in his first Triple Crown final at the age of 42, led 4-1 but missed a straightforward red for a 5-1 lead.
O'Sullivan won seven frames in a row to move 8-4 ahead before Perry, helped by breaks of 117 and 92, fought back.
But O'Sullivan, 41, sealed victory to defend his title and move ahead of Stephen Hendry's six Masters wins.
Victory means O'Sullivan claimed the newly named Paul Hunter trophy - in honour of the three-time champion who died of cancer aged 27 in 2006 - as well as the £200,000 winners' prize money.
It also ensured the world number 13 ended a run of three defeats in finals this season and defended the title he won last year by thrashing Barry Hawkins 10-1.
"Joe played a brilliant tournament, a really good match and he should've beaten me. I got lucky - I stole it," said O'Sullivan.
"Joe will come again and he is a tough competitor. I'm just relieved to have got over the line. The fans have been unbelievable and I really enjoyed this week."
On winning seven Masters title, O'Sullivan added: "It is great to get some records, I still have the World Championship one to get.
"When I was younger I was just happy to win one, so to win seven, someone up there is looking after me."
'The Rocket' had to deal with a virus in his first-round final-frame victory over Liang Wenbo and needed to repair a broken cue tip in the semi-final against Marco Fu, which he said was the "best match he has ever won".
In the final, O'Sullivan seemed unsettled by noise coming from a backstage table early on, but pulled himself together to level the match 4-4 at the interval.
He claimed a 32-minute ninth frame to move into the lead for the first time, and then knocked in breaks of 85 and 68 to take control.
At 8-6 and with Perry fighting back, O'Sullivan made his first century of the match - a break of 112 - and 859th of his career.
The Englishman then held his nerve to win a 20-minute tactical frame and claim his 17th Triple Crown title.
Along with seven Masters - the first of which he won in 1995 - he has also claimed five World and five UK Championship crowns, and is now just one behind Hendry's record of 18.

Perry has only won one ranking title - the 2015 Players Championship - but seemed to take to the occasion well, with breaks of 72, 74 and 115 giving him a surprise lead.
But rattling the final red in the jaws of the pocket when presented with the opportunity to go 5-1 up seemed to dent his confidence.
Fair play to Ronnie, even when he is not at his best he is still amazing
Although he rallied by clawing back three frames late on, O'Sullivan's substantial advantage was too great to overturn.
"I've proved a lot, that there is still some life left in me and it has given me the belief to go on and win a big one," said Perry.
"At 4-1 up I got a bit carried away and it was not until I was 8-4 down I thought, 'I'm going for it'.
"It's given me the taste to go for more finals, it's a great feeling to be involved and you take snooker up for nights like this.
"Fair play to Ronnie, even when he is not at his best he is still amazing."

Input: General Ali Fadavi accused those detained of "unprofessional" acts.
But he suggested the group, who are being held by the guards, could be released soon.
The incident comes at a sensitive time, as the US and Iran try to implement the deal on Iran's nuclear activities.
US Secretary of State John Kerry has contacted Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif over the incident.
Giving his assessment of the talks, Gen Fadavi said "Mr Zarif had a firm stance, saying that they were in our territorial waters and should not have been, and saying that they [the US] should apologise".
"This has been done and it will not take long, and the naval force, according to its hierarchy, will act immediately upon the orders it receives," he added.
This naval incident comes at a delicate moment for both Washington and Tehran.
The process to begin lifting the sanctions imposed on Iran due to its nuclear activities is expected to get under way at the end of this week.
There are many conservatives and hardliners in both countries who would dearly love to sabotage the deal and consequently both governments may be eager - whatever the attendant rhetoric -  to get this episode resolved as quickly as possible.
How it plays out will be an important signal as to the balance of power in Tehran itself.
The Revolutionary Guard Corps, whose naval branch detained the US vessels and their crews,  is amongst the more hardline elements ranked up against the nuclear deal.
But the potential economic benefits of lifting the sanctions may be too great an inducement for the agreement to be derailed now.
US officials have said the sailors - nine men and a woman - are likely to be released on Wednesday. There has been no confirmation from Washington that Mr Kerry apologised.
One of the two US riverine patrol boats developed mechanical problems while on a training mission between Bahrain and Kuwait, the US officials added.
The crew and vessels have been taken to Farsi Island, the site of an Iranian naval base.
Iran's influential Revolutionary Guard - tasked with protecting the country's 1979 Islamic revolution - has strongly defended Iranian sea borders in the past.
Fifteen British sailors and marines were held for 13 days in 2007 after they were captured in a disputed area between Iran and Iraq.
Despite last year's breakthrough nuclear deal tensions remain between the US and Iran.
In December, Iran's navy conducted rocket tests near US warships in the Strait of Hormuz, something the US called "highly provocative".
Response list: ["Iran's navy has detained US sailors in the Persian Gulf, a US official has said."]

Clarkson pulled out of hosting the BBC One panel show in April, after being sacked from Top Gear after a "fracas".
He is set to front a new motoring show for Amazon next year, alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond.
Clarkson's appearance on Have I Got News For You will be his first on the BBC since his departure from Top Gear.
He was suspended in March after assaulting producer Oisin Tymon, and the BBC later confirmed his contract would not be renewed.
At the time, BBC director-general Tony Hall said "a line has been crossed" and that "there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another".
Clarkson signed up to present Have I Got News For You on Friday, and his appearance will mark the start of the show's 50th series.
When he pulled out of hosting in April, production company Hat Trick had suggested the presenter would appear on the show soon.
A statement said: "On reflection, Jeremy Clarkson has decided not to host Have I Got News For You. We fully expect him to resume his hosting duties later in the year."
Pointless assistant host Richard Osman will be one of the two guests joining Clarkson for the opening episode.

Input: The Royal Mint has said that it saw a "surge" in demand for the precious metal following the Bank of England's cut in base rates to 0.25% on 4 August.
During that week the Mint saw a 25% increase in transactions on its bullion website.
It also experienced a 50% increase in sales of gold bars and coins, compared with the previous week.
It is thought investors are turning to gold as cash and bonds offer diminishing returns, exacerbated by lower interest rates.
So far this year, the price of gold has risen by 45% in sterling terms, and 25% in dollar terms.
"Although the stock market has been doing well of late, it didn't do so well at the start of the year, and there was a lot of volatility around the time of the referendum," said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Landown.
"That helps gold."
However he also warned that gold prices will not necessarily continue rising.
"It's worth pointing out gold is by no means a one way bet - in 2011 it was trading at above $1800 an ounce. It's an insurance policy for the rest of your investments and as such should make up no more than 5-10% of your portfolio."
Gold is currently trading at $1344 an ounce.
Earlier this week, the World Gold Council reported that global investment demand for gold hit a record level in the first six months of this year.
However consumer demand in countries such as  India and China, traditionally among the strongest buyers of gold, was lower.

Input: Aqib Mazhar, of Russell Road, was stabbed in the chest on the street where he lived on 1 June and died from a single stab wound in hospital.
His car was blocked in by three vehicles, trapping him as he came under attack, police said.
The four men, aged between 18 and 24, from Nottingham and Derby, all pleaded guilty to manslaughter.
Over weeks animosity grew between Mr Mazhar and a group of men and it culminated that evening, the court heard.
At the sentencing at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday, Judge Stuart Rafferty told the offenders Mr Mazhar's death was "wholly needless".
Mohamud Alasow, 18, of Hamilton Road, Nottingham, was jailed for 10 years and six months.
Junaid Farrukh, 21, of Heathermead Close, Oakwood, Derby; and Mohammed Qasim, 24, of Staindale Drive, Aspley; were both sentenced to nine years and 11 months in prison.
Qamran Ahmed, 21, also of Staindale Drive, received a seven-year sentence.
The men were initially on trial for murder, but the charge was changed to manslaughter during the two-week trial last week.
Mobile phone footage thought to show one of the defendants as Mr Mazhar killer was reviewed and revealed a fifth person, who is on the run, carried out the fatal stabbing.
Judge Rafferty said: "This is not a murder case, none of you stabbed Aqib... the murderer is still at large.
"The tragedy of this case is that all four of you know perfectly well who stabbed Aqib, but you have done nothing to speak out to put Aqib's family at their ease."
Det Ch Insp Rob Severn, of Nottinghamshire Police, said the investigation and the hunt for the person who fatally stabbed Mr Mazhar was continuing.
Response list: ['A four-man murder trial has been suspended after a man who was stabbed to death was found guilty of manslaughter.']
Ground truth: Four men have been jailed for killing a 21-year-old stabbed in a car ambush on a Nottingham street.

Input: The suspects fled into the bushes towards Zimbabwe after their efforts to free the car from the sand failed, local police say.
Last December a vehicle stolen in Durban was recovered on the same river, attached to a group of donkeys.
Local police are investigating whether a syndicate is behind the new practice.
Police Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo says a Mercedez Benz C220 was recovered on the river bed close to Musina.
The suspects had put metal sheets under the wheels to make it easier to pull across the sand.
"The suspects were using donkeys to pull the car across the riverâ€š but our members were just in time to pounce on them after the donkeys were apparently no longer able to pull it through the sand," Mr Mojapelo is quoted in local media as saying.
The donkeys were unharmed.
It is not clear why the thieves do not simply driver the car into Zimbabwe but one reason might be that most modern cars are fitted with a tracking device which uses satellite tracking to locate a vehicle, if stolen.
The tracker is only active when the car is running.
The Limpopo River forms the border between South Africa and Zimbabwe and is a well known transit point for illegal immigrants moving between both countries but the news of it becoming a smuggling point for cars is a surprise development, says the BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg.
Authorities regularly patrol the Beit-Bridge border post to monitor movements between the two countries in a bid to curb cross-border crime, our correspondent says.
Response list: ['A group of thieves who stole a car from a car wash in Durban, south Africa, have been caught in a river near the border between Zimbabwe and South Africa.']

Input: Khadija Ibrahim, 30, told reporters she had been waiting for a bus to hospital in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri when she was seized by two men in a car who had offered her a lift.
While drugged, the mother of three was stripped and a suicide belt attached, she is quoted as saying.
She managed to flee her abductors.

'How I almost became a suicide bomber'
Ms Ibrahim said after getting into the car, she fell unconscious when something was placed over her nose.
But she woke up, apparently without her captors realising, to hear one of them whispering to her that she was "going to do God's work".
The kidnappers told her she was being taken to the city of Kano to attack the Kantin Kwari textile market.
But when the car engine overheated, both kidnappers were distracted - one was examining the engine while the other went to look for water.
Ms Ibrahim then managed to flee and a man in the Hotoro neighbourhood of Kano took her to the police.
She was also brought before the Kano state governor, Umar Ganduje, who told the media: "If this woman had not regained consciousness the story would have been  different by now."
The woman is now in "safe custody....undergoing post-traumatic rehabilitation," Kano police spokesman Magaji Musa Majiya told the BBC's Hausa service.
Police are trying to track down the vehicle in an attempt to find a second kidnapped girl, thought to be about 15 years old, he added.
The other woman in the car with her may also have been drugged, Ms Ibrahim suggested.
Boko Haram has staged numerous attacks using young women in the past year.

Input: Public Health England (PHE) wants widespread vaccination to stop flu spreading to "at risk" people.
These include pregnant women, young children, over 65s and those with conditions such as asthma and diabetes.
Last winter 904 people were admitted to intensive care with flu and 98 of them died.
Children up to the age of three were eligible for free vaccination last year, and four-year-olds have now been included.
For those aged two, three and four, this is given as a nasal spray rather than an injection.
Flu viruses constantly mutate so a new vaccine is devised each year and annual jabs are needed to stay protected.
Flu has been comparatively mild in recent years, and health officials are concerned this could lead to complacency.
Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said: "Flu is a really unpleasant illness, particularly for our most vulnerable patients, and it is essential that people take steps to protect themselves during the winter months.
"I would urge those who are offered the free flu vaccination to visit their GP early in the flu season.
"I also urge all health care workers to make they are vaccinated to protect themselves, their patients and their families".
Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at PHE, said about 40% of pregnant women were vaccinated last year - a figure he hoped would be higher this year.
"Women can safely have the vaccine at any point during pregnancy and it can reduce the risk of complications such as pneumonia and premature birth, that can arise as a result of flu," he said.
The government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has advised offering free flu jabs to all two to 17-year-olds.
PHE is in the process of extending the coverage.
Similar vaccination schemes operate in Scotland, where two million people are to be offered free vaccination this year, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Response list: ['The government has extended the free flu vaccination programme to children aged two to four.']
Ground truth: Four-year-olds in England are to be offered free flu vaccinations for the first time as part of the annual drive to get people protected before winter.

Input: The London Somalia Conference, co-chaired by the UK, Somalia and the United Nations, will be held in Lancaster House, a grand mansion in the exclusive district of St James's. Many of the delegates will stay in swish hotels nearby.
This is the third such London gathering since 2012, and there is an element of "cut and paste" to its agenda, which focuses on security, governance and the economy.
The official conference document emphasises how much progress has been made.
But its description of Somalia from the time of the first meeting still applies: "Chronically unstable and ungoverned", and threatened by Islamist militants, piracy and famine.
There has been some improvement.
Piracy, which at its height cost $7bn (Â£5.4bn) a year, is much diminished, although there has been a recent resurgence.
US drones, African Union troops, Western "security advisers" and Somali forces have pushed al-Shabab from most major towns, although the jihadists still control many areas and attack at will.
A recent electoral process resulted in a new and - for the time being - popular president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, nicknamed Farmajo, and more female and youth representation in parliament.
Somalia is in a "pre-famine" stage rather than the full-blown disaster of 2011, in which more than 250,000 people died.
But it is perhaps surprising that the current water shortage will not be a headline topic at the conference.
The country is in the grip of its worst drought in decades. Four successive rainy seasons have failed.
Even before you enter Burao Regional Hospital, in the self-declared Republic of Somaliland's drought-stricken Togdheer region, you hear the haunting, high-pitched wailing of malnourished children.
One boy, dressed in purple, stares blankly at the wall. "His brain is damaged due to a prolonged lack of adequate nutrition," says Dr Yusuf Ali, who returned home to Somalia from the UK two years ago. "He will never recover."
According to Unicef, the number of children who are or will be acutely malnourished in 2017 is up by 50% from the beginning of the year, to a total of 1.4 million, including 275,000 for whom the condition is or will be life-threatening.
Most are too sick to go to school or help herd animals, making the life of the country's many nomads even more precarious.
People are already dying from hunger and diseases that strike those weakened by lack of food.
Severely malnourished children are nine times more likely than healthy ones to die from illnesses such as measles and diarrhoea.
The World Health Organization says there were more than 25,000 cases of cholera in the first four months of 2017, with the number expected to more than double to 54,000 by June.
More than 500 people have already died from the disease.
It is not just humans who are suffering.
In Somaliland, officials say, 80% of livestock have died.
Livestock is the mainstay of the economy - the ports in Somaliland and nearby Djibouti export more live animals than anywhere else in the world, mainly to the Gulf.
In south-western Somalia, tens of thousands of drought-affected people have fled to Baidoa, clustering into flimsy, makeshift shelters on the outskirts of the city.
This area - known as the "triangle of death" - was the epicentre of the famines of 2011 and 1991.
"Al-Shabab is harvesting the boys and men we left behind on our parched land, offering them a few dollars and a meal," says one woman. "Against their will, our children and husbands have become the jihadists' new army."
"The biggest problem in dealing with this drought is insecurity," says Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden, president of South West State, in his modest palace in Baidoa.
The city, which is protected by a ring of Ethiopian troops, is right in the heart of al-Shabab country. "The militants have closed all the roads so we cannot deliver help to those who need it most."
This brings home in the starkest of terms why security is top of the London Somalia Conference agenda.
As long as Somalia remains violent, with different parts of the country controlled by a multitude of often conflicting armed groups, it will be impossible to deliver emergency assistance, let alone long-term development.
The recently created South West State is one of the regions making up the new federal Somalia.
Critics fear this will lead to balkanisation, and risks introducing another dimension to conflict, as the new states rub up against each other and start fighting. This has already happened in central Somalia, where last year there were deadly clashes between Puntland and Galmudug states.
The attitude of people in South West State shows how much of a gamble the federal system is.
"We have always been marginalised and looked down on by other Somalis," says a farmer, Fatima Issa.
"We do not want the federal troops here. They don't hunt down al-Shabab the way our local militias do. We should push for more autonomy, maybe even break away and declare independence like Somaliland did in 1991."
One aim of the London Somalia Conference is to push for more progress on the sharing of resources between the regions and the centre. This contentious issue has been debated since before the first London gathering in 2012.
South West State has a special friendship with Ethiopia, which is not on the best of terms with the new federal government. This highlights another possible problem - some foreign powers have started to sign bilateral agreements with regional states.
For instance, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is building a military base in Somaliland, a territory the federal government considers an integral part of Somalia. The UAE has also given military hardware to Jubaland State in southern Somalia.
Somalia's former special envoy to the US, Abukar Arman, has described the London Somalia Conference as a "predatory carnival", with foreign powers gathering to slice up Somalia for their own benefit.
Some in Somalia see it as a waste of time.
"It is an expensive talking-shop," says Ahmed Mohamed, a rickshaw driver in the capital Mogadishu. "The politicians and diplomats are obsessed with the conference instead of taking action on the drought."
But lessons have been learned, and there is now a far more nuanced approach to Somalia than there was when the crisis began, in the late 1980s.
The US response to the Somali famine of 1991 was to send in nearly 30,000 troops. This ended in a humiliating withdrawal, following the shooting down of two US Black Hawk helicopters in 1993.
Now, much of the talk is of "Somali-owned" processes, although the shadows of a growing number of foreign powers can be seen lurking in the background.
Response list: ['The London Somalia Conference is to be held in the UK, with talks on security, development and the economy.']
Ground truth: This Thursday, the great and the good will descend on London to discuss Somalia, a country that has topped the Fragile States Index for eight of the past 10 years.

Input: Ms Clwyd was speaking for the first time about the report into Owen Roberts' death at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff in 2012.
She has said her husband was treated like a "battery hen."
Cardiff and Vale University Health Board has apologised unreservedly and said the failings were "unacceptable".
The Cynon Valley MP has made a public protest about the care her late husband received while he was in hospital last year.
She said her husband was treated with coldness, indifference and even contempt by NHS staff "who didn't care".
After speaking out about her concerns, Prime Minister David Cameron asked her to review how hospitals in England deal with complaints from patients and their families.
She has now received a confidential report from the health board and spoke about her husband's care in a Commons debate on NHS complaints.
Speaking on BBC Radio Wales she said: "I did feel that it was very difficult to speak to nursing staff.
"In fact, on the night before he died I stopped a nurse in a corridor and asked why he wasn't in intensive care and she brushed me aside and said 'there are a lot worse than he is' and then walked on.
"So I didn't even have a discussion with her and, of course, the next day Owen died."
Ms Clwyd compared her husband's 27 hours on a trolley in A&E or its spill-over ward with the four-hour target introduced in England a decade ago.
She said: "If they think four hours is too long, then 27 hours definitely is.
"There is an admission that he should not have been nursed in that area for the length of time he remained there and that it fell significantly below the standard expected and this is unacceptable.
"That's just one aspect of it. There were lots of things about his care I was concerned about."
Ms Clwyd said that she had asked a GP friend to examine the report and said her conclusion was that "Owen was not properly treated or investigated".
The health board said it wanted to offer its "sincere condolences" to Ms Clwyd and her family.
It said: "Given the gravity of the concerns raised by Ms Clwyd about her husband's care, we set up an independent panel to oversee an investigation.
"The panel was made up of Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan Community Health Council, the patient watchdog, Health Inspectorate Wales and an independent member of the health board.
"The investigation was undertaken in line with the requirements of the NHS concerns process, Putting Things Right.  Every concern raised by Ms Clwyd was investigated.
"We have shared the outcome of the investigation with Ms Clwyd and have offered to meet with her to discuss the findings.
"It would not be right for us to publish what is a private report for Ms Clwyd. In view of Ms Clwyd's comments however, we would welcome Ms Clwyd releasing the report in its entirety into the public domain.
"We fully appreciate how difficult it is for anyone to raise concerns about the care of a loved one at such an emotional time and we would like to thank Ms Clwyd for her input into the investigation, which has been invaluable in helping us understand her experience."
Response list: ['A former nurse who spoke out about her late husband\'s treatment in hospital has said she was "coldly treated" by NHS staff.']
Ground truth: The late husband of Labour MP Ann Clwyd was kept on a trolley in the emergency department of Wales' largest hospital for 27 hours, she has revealed.

'Cashgate' - Malawi's murky scandal
The BBC's Raphael Tenthani in Blantyre says dozens of civil servants have been charged in the "cashgate" investigations and so far there have been at least five convictions.
The scandal has revealed several cases of money being spent without services being provided.
The two military men may be facing charges of abuse of public office, negligence by a public officer in preserving money and money laundering, a statement from the ACB says.
An investigation has found that the army paid $4.4m (Â£2.8m) for the equipment that was not supplied.
The "cashgate" issue came to light in September 2013 after the attempted assassination of the finance ministry's budget director Paul Mphwiyo.
Just days before, a junior civil servant was allegedly found with more than $300,000 in cash in the boot of his car.
More cash was confiscated from some civil servants' homes and car boots.
Malawi's donors then withheld $150m pending further investigation into the scandal.

Input: The militants attacked from four sides of the city in the middle of the night.
Mahmood Danish, spokesman for the provincial governor, said Afghan forces had repelled the attack.
Kunduz was briefly captured by the Taliban last September -  the first time the insurgents had taken a major city - but government forces, backed by Nato, recaptured it within days.
In southern Helmand province, militants have also taken a strategically important district to the south of Lashkar Gah, killing the local police chief, officials say.
A number of other police casualties were also reported.
Residents in Kunduz told the BBC they heard heavy fighting and helicopters flying over the strategically important city.
Mohammadullah Bahej, head of the police co-ordination office in Kunduz, said the militants had been pushed back but fighting was continuing on the outskirts of the city.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the Taliban had captured several checkpoints in the city.
"A massive operation started on Kunduz capital from four directions early this morning," Mr Mujahid said via his official Twitter account.
The capture of Kunduz by the Taliban last September was a huge blow to the country's Western-backed government. The militants abandoned the city after four days but they had proved their growing capability.
The group raided Tarin Kot, the provincial capital of Uruzgan, earlier this month.
Afghan government forces are estimated to have control over no more than two-thirds of Afghanistan.
The attacks come ahead of a major international donor conference in Brussels on Tuesday, where Afghanistan's international partners will discuss ongoing funding for the country.

Input: The British Retail Consortium (BRC) analysed 10 billion retail payments in 2012 - 60% of all UK retail sales.
Cash accounted for about 54% of all transactions, but non-cash, non-card payments rose from less than 2% to 5% of the total.
Debit cards also remained popular, the figures showed.
Use of cash in terms of the number of transactions and money spent in shops was down on the previous year. This was the first time in the survey's 13-year history that both measures recorded a fall.
Alternative means of payment, such as online payments and money-off coupons, grew, although these remained a fraction of the total.
"These methods will be the 'ones to watch' in the future, and retailers are investing heavily to make sure their customers have choice and convenience in ways to pay, whether in-store, at home or on the move," said Helen Dickinson, director general of the BRC.
Debit cards accounted for 30% of transactions, while credit cards or charge cards were used in nearly 11% of cases.
The BRC repeated its concern that credit card transactions cost retailers significantly more to process than cash.
Response list: ['Cash payments have fallen to 54% of all transactions in the UK, according to a new survey.']
Ground truth: Cash is still the most popular form of payment in UK shops but the popularity of vouchers and coupons is on the rise, research has suggested.

Input: Joe Smyth, who achieved UKIP's highest vote share in Wales in 2015, said Mr Gill showed "no leadership" during its turmoil over assembly poll selections.
Another three general election candidates, two standing in May's poll, have also called for Mr Gill to go.
A UKIP Wales spokesman said Mr Gill had "stood up constantly" for "proper representation" for the Welsh members.
On Tuesday, Mr Gill announced local members would now decide the rankings for UKIP's regional list candidates, seen as the party's best hopes for winning seats.
Mr Smyth, re-selected for Islwyn at May's assembly election, said Mr Gill should have insisted the Welsh party ran whole the selection process.
There were complaints within the party about the original plan for its National Executive Committee (NEC) to have the final say.
Mr Gill has described the move to give local branches a vote over the final rankings as a "great victory" over the NEC.
But some remain unhappy that former Conservative MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless are still in the running for selection.
At the general election, Mr Smyth won 19.8% of the vote in Islwyn.
Despite being re-selected for the constituency for the assembly poll, he pulled out of the regional list selection in protest at the way it was being organised.
Mr Smyth told BBC Wales both Mr Gill and the NEC had treated members, activists and candidates with "contempt".
"He's trying to make out now that he's saved the selection process by allowing the Welsh members to vote on the candidates, it's a fallacy," he said.
"Nathan was responsible and agreed to how the selection process was going to be run at the very beginning.
"It's completely and utterly farcical."
Accusing Mr Gill of "weak leadership", Mr Smyth called for him to "resign straight away".
The criticisms were endorsed by Blair Smillie, UKIP's candidate for Alyn and Deeside at the general election.
"Nathan Gill has been terrible, he has to go," he said.
"There is no leadership in Wales, the organisation in north Wales is in disarray."
Nigel Williams, standing in the Delyn constituency in May after running for UKIP in 2015, said he had been "concerned for some time we lack leadership across Wales".
"We've let the general election momentum slip, we need better leadership," he said.
Ken Beswick, UKIP's Torfaen general election candidate added: "Nathan Gill is not suitable as a leader - he has no backbone.
"He's very close to Nigel Farage and won't stand up to him."
Responding to the criticism, a UKIP spokesman said: "Far from being weak he's actually been very determined in his commitment to ensuring the process is not controlled by party elites.
"The selection process has been deeply complex to ensure the best outcome; there will always be people dissatisfied.
"We think putting the decision in the hands of the membership is the most democratic option.
"All candidates that will be submitted to the membership have been rigorously vetted to ensure the highest calibre candidates are put forward to represent UKIP Wales."
Response list: ["UKIP's candidate for the Isle of Wight assembly seat has called for the party's leader to resign."]
Ground truth: Four former UKIP general election candidates have called for the party's Welsh leader Nathan Gill to resign.

Input: However, Prime Minister Isaac Zida, who was also detained when the presidential guard stormed a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, remains under house arrest.
The African Union has suspended Burkina Faso and threatened sanctions unless the junta releases all interim political figures from detention.
The US and France have also condemned the coup in the former French colony.
The coup leaders have agreed to the "principle of dialogue", as two West African leaders arrived in the country to mediate in the crisis.
At least three people have died in protests in the capital, Ouagadougou, after an ally of ex-President Blaise Compaore was named leader on Thursday.
The influential Balai Citoyen civil society group has put the number of people who have died in demonstrations against the presidential guard (RSP) , at 10.
An unknown number of protesters have also been detained.
The BBC's Laeila Adjovi in Ouagadougou says demonstrators gathered around the airport for the arrival of a delegation from the regional body, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).
The delegation was led by Senegal's President Macky Sall, the current Ecowas chair, and Benin's leader Thomas Boni Yayi.
Ahead of their arrival, the air and land borders were officially re-opened.
Security forces again fired in the air on Friday to disperse to demonstrators who burned tyres and blocked streets in the city, our reporter says.
Elections were due to be held in the West African nation on 11 October, nearly a year after a popular uprising forced Mr Compaore, the long-time ruler of the West African country, from power.
Coup leader Gen Gilbert Diendere, who was Mr Compaore's former chief-of-staff, told reporters that Mr Kafando was now in his official residence.
He was reportedly freed on Thursday but has not yet been seen in public.
Two other minister have also been released, the coup leaders say.
The decision to free them was made "as a sign of easing tensions and in the general interest", a statement read on national television said.
Prime Minister Zida was the army officer who took charge after Mr Compaore was ousted.
The lieutenant colonel was number two in the RSP, where he may still hold influence, which explains his continued detention, says BBC Afrique's Lamine Konkobo.
The elite presidential guard has been trained, in part, by the US. It is the most powerful armed group in Burkina Faso and often disrupted the activities of the transitional government as it tried to cling to the privileges it enjoyed under Mr Compaore's rule.
It is seen to be close to him, and is not popular on the streets. So its seizure of power could be a recipe for serious violence.
The transitional government might have made two mistakes - preventing politicians loyal to Mr Compaore from running in next month's elections and allowing the Reconciliation Commission, formed to heal wounds after the end of his authoritarian rule, to release a report calling for the presidential guard to be disbanded.
Some argue that a newly elected president would have had greater legitimacy to take such action.
Mr Compaore is currently in exile and was accused of committing widespread abuses, and trying to change the constitution to extend his term in office.
Some of his key allies had been barred from contesting the election.
Gen Diendere has said he has had no contact with Mr Compaore and will do everything to "avoid violence that could plunge the country into chaos".
An earlier announcement on state television said wide-ranging talks would be held to form a new interim government that would organise "peaceful and inclusive elections".
Transitional parliamentary speaker Cheriff Sy called for people to "immediately rise up" against the coup, and declared himself the leader.
The coup was announced on the day that a judge was due to give the results of DNA tests on the remains of former President Thomas Sankara, his widow Mariam Sankara told the BBC.
Her husband was killed in a 1987 coup that saw Mr Compaore and fellow officers such as his close friend Gen Diendere take power.
The family want to know the exact circumstances of his death, which have always been shrouded in mystery.

Input: NFU official Gordon Corner said 50 men and children were involved in an incident in Midville on Monday which "terrorised" a farmer.
A 24-hour dispersal order was put in place on Wednesday by police after officers received "a high volume of hare coursing-related incidents".
More than 2,000 calls have been made to Lincolnshire Police during 2015-16.
Hare coursing has been illegal throughout the UK since 2005. The Hunting Act 2004 makes it an offence to hunt wild mammals with dogs.
Mr Corner, an adviser for the NFU's Holland region, which covers that part of Lincolnshire, welcomed the dispersal order but said: "The thing is they need to catch them first so they can issue the order and hare coursing currently in Lincolnshire is out of control."
Speaking about the Midville incident, Mr Corner said the gang of 50 people drove across fields in 10 vehicles.
"One police car turned up quite quickly. The hare coursers dispersed, they caught seven men but we don't know what happened to them," he said.
"We've had lots and lots of meetings with them [police], we've had lots of discussions about how we and farmers can help. But we need to have some action.
"If [police] took the information they got and use it, then I think they would have a better success rate [with tackling hare coursing].
Tim Casey, a farmer near Coningsby, said some farmers were "at breaking point" and could be forced to tackle the crime themselves.
Rural crime officer PC Nick Willey said the force was doing all it could but added it should look at other ways of combating the crime.
The force's police and crime commissioner Marc Jones added: "I have recently contacted the chief constable to raise these matters and to make clear the importance I place on rural community safety.
"I believe the force is currently assessing the most effective operational response and yesterday's order is only the beginning."
Traditionally, coursing incidents start to rise in the autumn after crops have been harvested. They then continue until spring.

Input: The narrowing of the gap reflected a 2% increase in exports of goods and services, taking them to £43.8bn.
Imports fell by 0.5% to £48.3bn.
Although the pound fell sharply after the Brexit vote, which should make UK products cheaper abroad, the ONS said it was too early for firm conclusions.
The pound was 15% lower against other currencies in July compared with the same time a year ago, the ONS said.
The ONS points out in its release that the general consensus among economic commentators is that the recent depreciation in the pound should boost export and manufacturing competitiveness.
However, it says this does not necessarily occur as the price of imported materials used to make UK goods rises as  the pound falls.
Analysis: Andy Verity, BBC economics correspondent
Devaluation: the economic equivalent of caffeine. Drop the value of the pound by a tenth and your exporters get a stimulus; suddenly their goods are 10% less in dollars - making them cheaper and therefore more competitive. In the last week and a half, two striking economic updates have been published,suggesting the weak pound has helped.
Today it is the trade deficit. The fact that we as a country buy more than we sell - also known as a trade deficit - has been a persistent problem in the UK for at least two decades. But in July it narrowed by £1.1bn to £4.5bn. The other data was from manufacturers last week, who said the weak pound had helped stimulate the biggest jump in orders and new business for 20 years.
If that effect were sustained then it could help to achieve something the last government only talked about - the re-balancing of the economy. First, away from property and financial services and towards manufacturing and engineering - "making things" (remember the "march of the makers" - the phrase is four years old and empty). And second, away from our chronic dependence on borrowing and financial services to sustain economic growth.
However, be careful. As Matthew Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation pointed out to me on Twitter, finance may be smaller than it was before 2008, but so is manufacturing. And the trade deficit narrowed - but by less than most economists had hoped.
A weak pound may have stimulated the economy, but it has not suddenly improved our underlying economic fitness. Like caffeine, it will eventually wear off.
Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the figures were more evidence of the UK economy's "current resilience" - despite fears the Brexit vote would stall investment and spending.
He said hopes were pinned on the weakness of the pound encouraging a long-term increase in exports.
"A major hope for the UK economy going forward is that the substantial overall weakening of the pound since the UK voted to leave the European Union in June's referendum will increasingly feed through to boost foreign demand for UK goods and services," Mr Archer said.
Response list: ['The UK economy has narrowed its trade deficit, according to figures released by the ONS.']
Ground truth: The UK trade deficit, which reflects the difference between imports and exports, shrank to £4.5bn in July from £5.6bn the previous month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Input: The defendants, known as Soldier A and Soldier C, are the surviving members of the Army patrol which shot Joe McCann.
They are aged 65 and 67, and were in the Parachute Regiment.
They are from England, but are expected to appear in court in Northern Ireland in the next few months.
Joe McCann was a prominent member of the Official IRA. He was 25 when he was shot near his home in the Markets area of Belfast.
The original police investigation was conducted in the early 1970s and no-one was prosecuted.
Prosecutors have reviewed the case after the Northern Ireland Attorney General, John Larkin, referred it to the Director of Public Prosecutions in March 2014.
This followed a report in 2012 by a police team which investigated alleged crimes from the Troubles.
A spokesperson for the Public Prosecution Service said the decision to prosecute the men for murder was reached "following an objective and impartial application of the test for prosecution".
Response list: ['Two men who were killed in a shooting in Northern Ireland have been prosecuted for murder.']
Ground truth: Two former soldiers are to be prosecuted for murder in relation to the fatal shooting of an Official IRA man in Belfast in 1972.

Input: Williams, aiming for a 22nd Grand Slam singles title, thrashed Magdalena Rybarikova 6-2 6-0 in just 42 minutes.
Djokovic, a defeated finalist in three of the last four years, beat Chinese Taipei's Yen-Hsun Lu 6-4 6-1 6-1.
Earlier, Australian Open champion Angelique Kerber was beaten by world number 58 Kiki Bertens.
Fifth seed Victoria Azarenka was another high-profile casualty, forced to retire with a thigh injury when trailing Italy's Karin Knapp 4-0 in the third set.
But nine-time champion Rafael Nadal advanced at speed and in style, taking only one hour and 20 minutes to overcome Sam Groth 6-1 6-1 6-1.
The 29-year-old Spanish fourth seed, who hit an astonishing winner through his legs in the third set, will face Argentine world number 99 Facundo Bagnis in the second round after taking his career French Open record to 71 wins and two losses.
Djokovic will face Belgian Steve Darcis next, ahead of a potential third-round encounter with British number two Aljaz Bedene in the third round.
Djokovic, who won bronze at the Beijing 2008 singles and came fourth at London 2012, believes ranking points should be on offer at the Olympics.
The Olympics is organised by the International Tennis Federation, which has not reached an agreement with the men's and women's tours to recognise players' performances at Rio 2016.
John Isner admitted that the lack of points on offer was "a pretty big factor" in his decision not to represent the United States at the Games. Australian Bernard Tomic and Austria's Dominic Thiem have also made themselves unavailable to their countries.
"We have the best players in the world participating in arguably the fifth Grand Slam. It's of that importance for all of us, even more, because it happens every four years," Djokovic said.
"I would definitely encourage people to rethink getting points out there."
Third seed Kerber, who has yet to advance past the quarter-finals at Roland Garros, lost 6-2 3-6 6-3.
The German, 28, lost her opening matches at the Madrid and Rome tournaments and a shoulder injury ruled her out of Nuremberg last week.
Bertens, from the Netherlands, won the title in Nuremberg.
"First rounds are always tough in the tournament, especially for me. What can I say? It happens," said Kerber, who stunned Serena Williams in Melbourne to win her maiden Grand Slam title earlier this year.
Eugenie Bouchard is now down at 47 in the rankings but her form of late has been a little more encouraging and she eased past Germany's Laura Siegemund 6-2 6-2.
The Canadian had a difficult season in 2015 after reaching the top 10 the previous year and found the whole experience so stressful it led to an eating disorder.
She said: "I felt a lot of pressure and kind of this expectation that if you win a match it's normal and if you lose it's a disaster.
"Before matches I was very nervous and definitely had trouble eating. I just felt like it would come right back up. It's a difficulty I went through. And not just before matches, but it happened to me at other meals as well.
"So people think I was concerned about my body image and things like that and I was losing weight on purpose. That was really not the case. I was just so stressed."
Francesca Schiavone had to deny she was retiring after Roland Garros' Twitter feed mistakenly announced this as her final appearance.
The 35-year-old Italian, who won the title in 2010 and reached the final again the following year, was given a prolonged ovation after her 6-2 6-4 loss to France's Kristina Mladenovic.
"I appreciate this situation," said Schiavone. "But I think that everybody thought this because Roland Garros announced it. It was not the last one for me."

Instruction: In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.
Input: More than 800 members of the Colombian army have been jailed so far in the "false positive" scandal.
Civilians were murdered and their bodies passed off as those of rebels or paramilitaries to boost the army's combat kill rate.
Colombia's attorney general is investigating thousands more cases.
All of them are alleged to have happened between 2002 and 2008, when the scandal broke.
In a report published on Wednesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that it had seen evidence strongly suggesting that "numerous generals and colonels knew or should have known about 'false positive' killings, and may have ordered or otherwise actively furthered them".
Most of the soldiers convicted so far in connection with the scandal are of low rank, although some did command units or even battalions.
The rights group said that it had reviewed transcripts or recordings of testimony provided to prosecutors directly accusing several of Colombia's highest ranking officers of "having known of, planned, or attempted to facilitate false positive killings while holding those positions".
Among those named in the report as those who knew or should have known of the crimes are the former head of the Joint Caribbean Command, retired Gen Gonzalez Pena and the former army commander, retired Gen Mario Montoya.
One of the brigades implicated by the evidence is the 15th Mobile Brigade.
According to the report, the brigade is under investigation for 38 extrajudicial killings allegedly committed between 2006 and 2008.
Sgt Carlos Eduardo Mora was a member of the 15th Mobile Brigade and has been a key witness.
In 2007, he was working for the unit's intelligence division. He told the BBC that when he noticed suspicious activities he tried to alert some of his superiors.
He said that his superiors warned him that his family would be killed if he told anyone about what he knew.
Despite the threat, Sgt Mora reported his suspicions to the attorney general's office at the end of 2008.
The evidence he provided led to the conviction of a number of members of his former brigade.
Its former chief of operations, Jesus Rincon Amado, was sentenced to 35 years in jail for a murder committed in 2007.
Col Santiago Herrera Fajardo, who commanded the brigade, is currently on trial.
Prosecutors are also investigating members of the 4th Brigade for at least 44 alleged extrajudicial killings carried out between 2001 and 2003.
During that time, the battalion was under the command of Gen Mario Montoya, who was later promoted to lead the Colombian Army.
Earlier this week, the attorney general's office announced that it had summoned the now retired Gen Montoya and three other generals to give evidence in July.
According to the HRW report, the battalions which were led at the time by the current commanders of the Colombian army, Gen Jaime Lasprilla, and of the armed forces, Gen Juan Pablo Rodriguez, are also among those being investigated.
Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos defended the two officers.
He said that both men had shown him documents which demonstrate that "there is not one single investigation against" them.
President Santos said that although wrongdoing should be punished, that the army should not be "tarnished".
HRW says the investigations have been hampered by threats and attacks on key witnesses.
A ministry of defence official told the BBC that they were "providing every possible protection" to the witnesses.
Lt Col Carlos Javier Soler Parra said that the government had put a protection scheme in place for members of the armed forces who have acted as witnesses.
But Sgt Mora has said that he fears for his life.
In its report, HRW also quotes prosecutors as saying that members of the armed forces "placed obstacles in the way of obtaining files crucial to their investigations".
In a statement, the army denied this, arguing that it had put teams in place specifically tasked with providing the required information to investigators.
"We are the first ones interested in clarifying the facts," it said.
Regardless of the obstacles, the attorney general's office is currently investigating at least 3,700 extrajudicial killings that took place within more than 180 battalions and other tactical units, according to HRW.
Response list: ['A former army commander has been convicted of a murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, according to a report by Human Rights Watch.']
Ground truth: Human Rights Watch has said that it has seen evidence suggesting high-ranking army officers in Colombia knew of the extrajudicial killings of civilians.

Input: They will be provided with a "disclosure pack" which "they may consider undermines the conviction in a specific case," a spokesperson said.
Three live cases where Mr Mahmood - dubbed the Fake Sheikh - was due to give evidence have also been dropped.
Mr Mahmood has previously said he used legitimate investigatory methods.
The decision to contact defendants was made after the CPS reviewed prosecutions following the collapse of the trial of former X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos in July.
The judge in that case said there were strong grounds for believing that Mr Mahmood had lied at a hearing before the trial started.
Subsequently, in a BBC Panorama investigation, one of Mr Mahmood's former colleagues at the News of the World claimed that they created elaborate stings to target celebrities unfairly.
As a result, former attorney general Lord Goldsmith told the same BBC programme that Mr Mahmood's record needed to be re-examined.
Lawyer Mark Lewis has been contacted by 16 people over possible civil claims against Mr Mahmood, including some not convicted of a crime.
He predicted that payouts to alleged victims if convictions are overturned could be "in financial terms, bigger than phone hacking ever was" because people have "lost their livelihoods, their homes and their incomes".
Mr Mahmood has previously said he has spent his career investigating crime and wrongdoing through legitimate investigatory methods, bringing many individuals to justice.
He said any criticism of him usually came from those he had exposed or people he had worked with who had an "axe to grind".
He is currently suspended from the Sun on Sunday following the collapse of Ms Contostavlos's trial.
A spokeswoman for the Sun said: "We are aware of the CPS statement. Mr Mahmood remains suspended and we are continuing our internal investigation into the matter."
A CPS spokesman said on Thursday that no defendants were currently in custody in cases involving Mr Mahmood.
In three live cases, prosecutors decided there was not a realistic prospect of conviction.
The spokesman added: "We are now considering past cases which resulted in a conviction in criminal courts in England and Wales based on evidence provided by Mr Mahmood, and have identified 25 cases.
"As part of this process, over the coming weeks, CPS Areas will be contacting representatives of the defendants - or defendants themselves as necessary - convicted in these cases in order to provide them with a disclosure pack - details of material which they may consider undermines the conviction in a specific case."
In September, several cases involving evidence from Mr Mahmood were halted.
The CPS offered no evidence against Dr Majeed Ridha and pharmacist Murtaza Gulamhusein, who were accused of illegally supplying an abortion drug.
Leon "Starino" Anderson and co-defendant Ashley Gordon also had drug charges dismissed.
Response list: ['A former Sun editor has been contacted by 16 people over possible civil claims against him.']
Ground truth: The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is to contact defendants in 25 cases where evidence was given by journalist Mazher Mahmood.

Input: The unfortunate creature did not survive the encounter with a high-voltage transformer at the site near Geneva in Switzerland.
The LHC was running when a "severe electrical perturbation" occurred in the early hours of Friday morning.
A spokesman for Cern said that the weasel did not get into the tunnels, just the electrical facilities.

Large Hadron Collider discovers new pentaquark particle
Arnaud Marsollier told the BBC that it would take a few days to repair the damage caused by the weasel's visit.
He added that while it was, fortunately, not every day that an animal affected the equipment, it was not that surprising as the research facility is in the countryside.
In 2009 the LHC was taken out by what was suspected to be a bird, though no remains were found.
Such "small issues" with the equipment were all part of the running of the LHC, Mr Marsollier said, and experts were used to carrying out repairs.
Cern's own report on the incident says that the weasel got into a 66kV transformer. The transformer connections were damaged.
"Not the best week for LHC!" it says.

Input: The "virtual orchestra" included everything from bell ringers to cellists, all of whom had uploaded their performance to the BBC.
A video combining all 1,200 performances was shown at Proms in the Park events around the UK and as part of BBC Two's coverage of the event.
The Prom also featured an unusual rendition of Rule Britannia.
Peruvian Juan Diego Florez chose to sing the anthem in B Major - the highest pitch ever chosen by a tenor at the event.
"I think it's more comfortable, more exciting, more fun," he told the BBC. "I'm glad that I'm the first one doing it."
The musician stole the show by performing the song in the colourful costume of Manco Capac, governor and founder of the Inca civilization.
Earlier, the dashing tenor had serenaded a cuddly toy of fellow Peruvian Paddington Bear during a performance of Guantanamera - part of a medley of popular Latin songs.
"He is as Peruvian as me," he told the audience. "You know, he was found in Paddington Station... [but] nobody in Peru knows about this.
"Anyway, I know him, I love him."
The build-up to the Last Night was marked by an attempt to hijack the concert's tradition of flag-waving for political means.
Anti-Brexit campaigners handed out EU flags outside the Royal Albert Hall, hoping for a wave of support from Prommers, who more usually wave union flags during the last night.
The organisers, who wanted to remain anonymous, said in a statement: "Music doesn't recognise borders, religion, gender, age, status or creed and most orchestras, shows and music schools rely heavily on talented musicians from inside and outside the EU."
They added: "Accordionist Romano Viazzani summed it up perfectly when he said: 'Music is the universal language. It builds bridges and tears down walls.'"
Prominent Brexit backer Aaron Banks retaliated by pledging to hand out five times as many union jacks as the Brexit team.
In the end, neither side prevailed - as the Royal Albert Hall sported flags from all around the world, including the German, Australian, Danish, Welsh and Cornish flags.
There was also a distinctly international flavour to the programme, conducted by Sakari Oramo, the Finnish music director of the BBC Symphony Orchestra.
He led the musicians through works by French, German, Russian and Italian composers; while Anne Dudley contributed a special arrangement of Fiesta Caribena!
Perhaps in response to the planned protest, Oramo told the audience: "Listening to music in a concentrated way gives us the chanceâ€¦ to find resolution, peace and unity.
"Music enables us to be in dialogue with each other, and our innermost selves. A dialogue which is more necessary in these days than ever before."
The concert also included Michael Torke's Javelin, which was originally performed at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and a hand-picked selection of young singers performing Vaughan Williams' Serenade to Music - a tribute to Henry Wood, whose name is synonymous with the Proms.
In keeping with tradition, the concert - and the 2016 season - closed with Rule Britannia, Land of Hope and Glory and Jerusalem.
Around the UK, classical music fans were able to join in the celebrations at Proms in the Park events; with special appearances by pianist Ruth McGinley and soprano Lesley Garret in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
Thirteen-year-old Gwydion Rhys was given the opportunity to conduct the BBC National Orchestra of Wales in a performance of Ride of the Valkyries at the Welsh Prom, in Colwyn Bay.
Britain's Got Talent winners Collabro appeared at the Scottish leg, in Glasgow Green; while London's line-up included Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, Rick Astley, Sir James Galway, Tim Minchin and the cast of Matilda The Musical.
The events brought the two month-long Proms season to a close, after more than 100 concerts.
Highlights included the  SimÃ³n Bolivar Orchestra, from Caracas, who put on a colourful, exotic evening, full of evocations of Latin America; and  a spine-tingling programme of Steve Reich, performed on the roof of a Peckham car park.
A late night Prom paid tribute to the life and music of David Bowie, with mixed results; while Quincy Jones and Strictly Come Dancing were also honoured with their own programmes.

Input: The Pope was shown pressing a button on an iPad tablet at the Vatican.
The message read:  "Dear friends, I am pleased to get in touch with you through Twitter. Thank you for your generous response. I bless all of you from my heart."
A spokesman said earlier the pontiff would "reach out to everyone" with accounts in eight languages.
After his introductory tweet on Wednesday, Benedict posted two follow-up messages.
By Alan Johnston BBC News, Rome
This venture into the Twittersphere is meant to reflect the Vatican's commitment to being part of the debate in cyberspace.
People are being asked to put questions to the Pope. And among those already posted, some are funny, and many others crude or silly. But some are sincere.
As one Vatican insider put: "The Pope's job description is to spread the word, and Twitter is a good way of doing that."
And being limited to the use of just 140 characters should not be too much of a hindrance.
The Christian message has often been at its most powerful when it's been at its most succinct.
Think of the Ten Commandments; "Thou shalt not kill" - just 16 characters.
They focused on promoting the Church's recently launched Year of Faith - an initiative intended to re-energise Catholicism.
"How can we celebrate the Year of Faith better in our daily lives?" the pontiff asked.
And he answered: "By speaking with Jesus in prayer, listening to what he tells you in the Gospel and looking for him in those in need."
Benedict's English account already has more than 700,000 followers and is growing fast.
So far, the Pope's accounts @pontifex - which mean "pontiff" or "builder of bridges" -  are only following each other.
Last year, the Pope sent his first tweet from a Vatican account to launch the Holy See's news information portal.
The leader of the world's 1.2 billion or so Roman Catholics is expected to sign off, rather than write, each individual tweet himself.
The Pope's tweets are also expected to highlight messages from his weekly general audience, Sunday blessings and homilies on key Church holidays as well as papal reaction to world events.
The Vatican has long shown interest in using the latest communications technologies to spread the faith with the inventor of radio, Guglielmo Marconi, setting up Vatican Radio in 1931.
The Catholic Church also already uses several social media platforms, including text messages and YouTube, to communicate with young people.
Papal aides say the pontiff himself still prefers to communicate in longhand rather than using a computer keyboard.
Pope Benedict's six-year papacy has been bedevilled by poor communications.
Embarrassing clarifications had to be issued over such thorny issues as his 2005 speech about Islam and violence, and his stance on condoms and HIV.

Input: Most of those killed were residents of the building, which was being renovated when fire engulfed it last November.
State media said local government officials, construction executives, and some workers would face charges.
Officials have been accused of breaking safety practices by turning a blind eye to the rules in exchange for bribes.
The fire on 15 November was initially blamed on careless unlicensed welders setting alight the netting around the building.
Most of the victims suffocated from the smoke and fumes; another 71 people were injured.
The reports in the China Daily and the Shanghai Daily newspapers did not say when a trial might take place.
The fire had raised questions about how corrupt relationships between senior figures in the construction companies and in government bodies might have contributed to the lack of safety on site.
The Shanghai Prosecutors' Office Director, Chen Xu, said on Monday that some of the executives whose roles are now under the spotlight worked for the Jingan District Construction Group.
This was the general contractor in charge of renovating the 28-storey building.
China's work safety officials have blamed the fire on illegal contracting, unsafe materials and poorly supervised, unqualified workers.
The State Council - China's cabinet - ordered a nationwide overhaul of fire prevention measures after the blaze.

Input: The festival, at Bramham Park, near Leeds, attracts around 80,000 people over the August Bank Holiday weekend.
Attendees often abandon sleeping bags and tents rather than carry them home.
Leeds No Borders, which campaigns on immigration issues, is one of a number of organisations which collects items left behind.
Emily Jennings, from Leeds No Borders, said volunteers had been shocked by the amount and quality of what had been abandoned.
"If we can share just a little with people who have nothing then that is at least one way forward."
Miss Jennings said the equipment they had collected would be sorted and cleaned before being taken to Calais.
Maya Conforti, from L'Auberge Des Migrants in Calais, says the salvaged kit will make a "big difference" at migrant camps.
She said: "There's been torrential rain in the last week which created huge flooding in the Jungle [the nickname of a camp in Calais], the place where the people survive, so we had to distribute tonnes of tents and sleeping bags."
"Conditions are way below international refugee camp standards, there are not enough toilets, the water points are dirty and there's no drainage.
"It's quite awful and there are about 3,500 people who live there. It's a European issue, an international issue."
Response list: ['A volunteer has collected more than 10,000 items from a refugee camp in Calais, France, after torrential rain caused flooding.']

Input: The Property Redress Scheme (PRS) does not take effective action, they say.
The PRS said it was not a regulator and could only help when an agent acted legally.
By law, letting agents cannot trade unless they are a member of one of three schemes, including the Property Redress Scheme.
However, dozens of customers of one rogue agent in London said when things went wrong, victims were not protected, a BBC You and Yours investigation has found.
Doni Soeyono bought a small two bedroom terrace house in Stanley Road in Ilford, east London 18 months ago as a rental property.
He signed up with Carter Stones, just round the corner in Connaught Road, which promised him a couple would rent the house for about £1,300 a month.
But in reality the couple Carter Stones claimed were renting the property did not live there.
Instead up to eight other people do, none with a contract. Mr Soeyono has not received any rent for six months.
He managed to get inside the house in the autumn and took pictures showing the sitting room with several beds.
When I went to the property with Mr Soeyono, we were shouted at by two women, who told us to go away. Then they left and walked down the street.
Mr Soeyono says he's seen one of the women a number of times and believes she lives in the property, helping to operate a subletting ring involving about 16 people.
But the owner says he has not had any useful response from Carter Stones.
Several landlords have contacted You and Yours complaining about unpaid rent, or legal documentation, and claim multiple people are living in the properties without any right to be there.
For more than 30 years, Teresa's family have owned a two bedroom terraced house in nearby St Mary's Road, Ilford.
She signed a management agreement with Carter Stones and was assured that a couple would be living in her house.
"Alarm bells rang when the council contacted me to ask who was responsible for the council tax at the house," Teresa said.
"They said many people were living in the house, but not the couple on the tenancy agreement."
Teresa says the people we met coming out of Mr Soeyono's house are also organising the subletting not only of her house but also her garage.
"I saw curtains up in the garage window, and the door was blacked out, but they would not let me in.
"Carter Stones declined all responsibility for this. They were not transferring me the rent and I couldn't get any sense out of them, even after telephoning them on a daily basis," she told me.
I tried to talk to Carter Stones, but while I could see two people in their office, each time I knocked they hid behind the door.
Since 2014 it has been a legal requirement for letting agents to be a member of one of three government-approved dispute resolution schemes: the Property Redress Scheme, the Property Ombudsman or the Ombudsman Service.
The Property Redress scheme costs £200 to join. It is run by the insurance company Hamilton Frazer, and unlike the two other organisations it is run for profit.
Carter Stones used to be a member of the PRS.
Last year the PRS upheld four complaints against Carter Stones but the company failed to pay compensation of £15,406. The PRS cannot enforce that order - the only redress it has is to expel rogue traders.
So in March 2016 the PRS expelled Carter Stones, making it illegal for the firm to continue trading. When Carter Stones stayed in business, Trading Standards became involved.
Redbridge Trading Standards then fined Carter Stones £5,000, but the company did not pay, and continued to trade. Trading Standards is still investigating.
In November 2016, seven months after Carter Stones was expelled from the scheme, Shakeel Ahmed paid £2,350 as a deposit to secure a flat to rent.
Even though the flat fell through, Carter Stones kept his money.
Several other prospective tenants have since contacted me with the same story.
When the landlords and prospective tenants complained to the PRS, they were told that as Carter Stones had been expelled from the scheme, nothing could be done.
"The PRS is pretty much useless," Mr Soeyono told me.
Teresa said: "The PRS is not effective at all, absolutely not in the case of a rogue agent. They're just using the scheme for their benefit."
The PRS does not require letting agents to sign up to a code of conduct, and does not publish a list of companies that have been expelled on its website.
Paul Shamplina, who is on the PRS advisory council, said that none of the redress schemes are regulators, but are "escalated complaint handling schemes put in place to prevent service related complaints from having to be issued in the court by consumers.
"This allows them access to a much quicker and cost effective remedy to resolve matters with property agents."
However, he said that when companies do flout the law, redress schemes are powerless, and complainants must rely on Trading Standards.

Response list: ['A letting agent who has been expelled from the Property Redress Scheme has been told that the scheme is useless.']

Input: Officers said a man on a quad bike was reported to have shot the raptor at about 17:15 on 4 May.
He was driving on moorland close to the B7040 at Elvanfoot when he fired the weapon. Witnesses reported that he drove off before the police arrived.
Landowners Leadhills Estate appealed for "information and clarity" over the reports.
Hen harriers are considered rare and are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act.
The man on the quad bike had his face covered at the time of the shooting, according to RSPB Scotland.
Sgt Craig Smith said: "Police Scotland is committed to tackling wildlife crime and reducing the number of crimes against our iconic birds of prey.
"We will continue to work with partners and the public to protect Scotland's wildlife.
"At this time I am asking for anyone who witnessed a man on a quad bike between Elvanfoot and Leadhills on the evening of Thursday 4 May to please contact police. You may hold valuable information which could assist our inquiry."
RSPB Scotland's head of investigations, Ian Thomson, said: "This latest incident shows very clearly how protected birds of prey continue to be treated in some areas of our uplands, particularly where there is intensive grouse moor management.
"The hen harrier is an increasingly rare bird in southern and eastern Scotland, with illegal killing the main driver of this long-term decline.
"This incident occurred only a few miles from where a satellite-tagged harrier, known as Annie, was found shot a couple of years ago, and is close to where another tagged bird, Chance, disappeared mysteriously last spring."
A spokesman for Leadhills Estate said: "The first we knew of this incident was a newspaper report and we contacted police immediately with a view to assisting them.
"At this stage we do not know the details of the incident but if a hen harrier has been shot we wholeheartedly support the police investigation and have launched our own internal inquiry.
"We want to make clear our condemnation of all forms of wildlife crime."
The estate said Leadhills was not currently an active grouse moor.
The spokesman added: "The estate acknowledges that 13 years ago and nine years ago gamekeepers were convicted of wildlife crime offences while employed by sporting tenants who had sole responsibility for sporting operations.
"Since October 2013, the estate has directly been responsible for sporting operations. We, and our staff, are wholly committed to the highest standards of moorland management."

Input: Former England defender Ehiogu died at the age of 44 on Friday after suffering a cardiac arrest the previous day.
Southgate and Ehiogu formed a centre-back pairing for almost 10 years at Aston Villa and Middlesbrough, winning the League Cup together at both clubs.
"He was a gentle giant away from football, he was a colossus on the pitch," Southgate said.
Ehiogu, who was Tottenham's Under-23s coach, was taken to hospital on Thursday after collapsing at the club's training ground, but a statement said he had died in the early hours of Friday morning.
Capped four times by England, Ehiogu made over 200 appearances for Villa between 1991 and 2000 and then spent seven years at Boro. The defender also played for West Brom, Leeds, Rangers and Sheffield United, before retiring in 2009.

"I'm stunned and deeply saddened by Ugo's passing and clearly my initial thoughts are with his wife Gemma, his children and his family.
"I know that football will be grieving because he was so highly respected by everybody he worked with and losing him at such a young age is difficult to come to terms with.
"Most importantly, he was a gentleman and he is one of those characters that people would find it difficult to have anything bad to say about him.
"I probably played more games with Ugo than anybody else in my career and while in many ways he was a gentle giant away from football, he was a colossus on the pitch. It felt like a true partnership with Ugo because we were prepared to put our bodies on the line for each other.
"We shared highs, lows and won a couple of trophies together with Villa and Boro and it's those memories that I will always cherish when I think of Ugo.
"He was one of the most professional people I played with in terms of how he applied himself to his job and it was great to see him progressing through the coaching pathway with that thirst for learning.
"I've spoken to several of our former team-mates today and there's just a sense of disbelief that we're having these conversations.

Input: The eastern side of Aleppo has been pulverised.
Running water and mains power are a memory. It is hard to find a building that is not badly damaged. Many look as if they could collapse at any time.
Rubble from the buildings that were flattened by artillery fire, barrel bombs or air strikes block many of the streets.
Dozens of bulldozers have been working for more than a month to clear a path through the debris.
East Aleppo remains a deeply inhospitable environment.
But the UN estimates that 40,000 people so far, and more every day, have decided to come back here. They are moving into their old homes or unoccupied buildings that look as if they might do, for a while at least.
Abu Hussein, a man in his 50s, was remarkably cheerful as he stood with his wife Umm Hussein and looked down from their balcony on to the rubble that makes his street impassable for any vehicle.
"Nothing is better or more beautiful than our home," he said. "It's the place to be in good times or in bad."
His family's flat is in Shaar, one of the poorest quarters in East Aleppo. The area is made up mainly of cramped concrete tenements five or six stories high - at least those still standing.
In Abu Hussein's street, some buildings have collapsed in on themselves.
Others have had the fronts ripped off, like dolls' houses in a nightmare, exposing beds still made up with sheets and blankets, and sofas teetering close to falling into the street.
Abu Hussein said he was happy because he was home, even though his flat was dark and cold.
His wife cooks on a small charcoal grill on the stairwell.
The glass in the windows has gone. It is so well ventilated that the dank mist of a winter's evening seeped in.
He had spent much of last year with his in-laws, he said, and the sooner they tried to make a go of it back home the better.
Abu Hussein and his wife have a two-year-old son who is still with her parents. They have no jobs, and the small amount of money they had saved went long ago.
"Of course we have hope," Umm Hussein said. "We'll rebuild and we'll find a solution."
They left East Aleppo two days before the start last year of the major offensive by the Syrian army, backed by Russia and Iran, which by Christmas had beaten the rebels and reunited the city.
During the years when the east was isolated, then besieged, it was possible to cross to government-controlled West Aleppo.
Abu Hussein said the trip, which now takes 15 minutes, was possible for anyone who was prepared to take a 17-hour journey through territory controlled by Syria's galaxy of armed groups, including the rebel Free Syrian Army, Kurdish militias, the jihadists of so-called Islamic State, and the armed forces of the Syrian government.
The United Nations, which spent more than $200m (Â£162m) on relief work in Aleppo last year, is particularly concerned that the poor in Shaar have come back out of desperation to a place that is still dangerous.
Relief agencies have put water tanks in the streets. Children struggle through mud and rubble to help their families by carrying water home.
Aleppo has changed since the government and its allies won the battle for the city last month.
It no longer feels like a wartime city. Outgoing artillery fire is still a steady drumbeat, aimed at rebel front lines that are not far away.
The country is at war. But Aleppo's war is over. In the ruins, people are thinking about the future.
Slowly but steadily, some of Syria's millions of displaced people are returning, desperate or optimistic, or both.
Large areas of the east side of the city are ghost towns, but there is every chance that more returnees will come back looking for a home once the weather gets warmer in the spring.
The battle for Aleppo was the most decisive of the war.
It is a long time since the war was merely a contest between President Bashar al-Assad and armed groups who wanted to destroy the regime.
So many foreign powers have intervened that this has become an international conflict. Syria has layers of war and not all of them are about the future of the Assad regime.
The intervention of Russia and Iran tipped the balance in Aleppo. Mr Assad and his allies can, for the first time, smell victory.
Foreigners, not Syrians, are setting the pace. And at the moment it looks as if foreign powers will dictate how the war ends.
Response list: ["A man in Aleppo's Shaar street is looking out over the rubble of his home."]
Ground truth: For the people who have returned to the ruins of East Aleppo the old phrase "there's no place like home" has a whole new meaning.

Input: In May 2016, police reports of hate incidents in schools were up 89% on the same month in 2015, the figures show.
The Times Educational Supplement obtained the data from 30 police forces under Freedom of Information law.
Robert Posner of the Anne Frank Trust UK said racist language had become more accepted since last June's referendum.
Mr Posner, chief executive of the charity, which runs a national programme tackling prejudice-related behaviours among young people, told the TES that the charity had heard more "disparaging" comments in school workshops since the vote.
"Language that we might consider to be either racist or prejudiced has become more normal and more accepted recently," said Mr Posner.
The TES sent freedom of information requests to all 39 of England's police forces.
Of the 32 forces to respond, 30 provided comparable data.
The figures revealed that compared with the same periods in 2015:
There were warnings of increases in bigoted behaviour among pupils at both the National Union of Teachers and Association of Teachers and Lecturers annual conferences last month.
A small survey of 345 ATL members published during their conference showed that more than a fifth of teachers had noticed hate crime or hate speech incidents in their schools during this academic year, and 17% believed it was a growing trend among pupils.
At the time, the union's general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said schools needed to educate children "to build a culture of tolerance and respect" as part of their anti-bullying policies.
"We hope that schools can support staff to educate young people in recognising and challenging hate crimes and hate speech wherever they occur," said Dr Bousted.
At the end of July last year the government announced a review of the ways in which police in England and Wales handle hate crimes and bullying against pupils and staff from minority groups after a sharp rise in the month after the EU referendum.

Input: Mr Osborne is meeting other finance ministers of the G20 group of major economies in Moscow.
The UK, Germany and France want to reform rules which let firms switch profits and costs between countries.
Labour's Ed Miliband said he "didn't see much evidence" Mr Osborne was actually tackling the problem.
Several well-known firms have been criticised over the amount of tax they pay on large UK revenues.
The BBC's Hugh Pym says the issue is "high on the list of priorities for policymakers at a time when companies like Amazon, Starbucks and Google have come under fire over the size of their tax payments".
The emergence of details regarding tax-avoidance strategies by multinational firms has sparked controversy, and calls for an overhaul of tax laws will be highlighted to finance ministers by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),  in a report published this week.
By Hugh PymChief economics correspondent, BBC News
The tax policies of Amazon, Google and Starbucks have intensified the debate about corporate behaviour and pushed it high up the agenda for policymakers.
Everyone agrees there is a limit to what national governments can do to close loopholes in a world of globalised capital flows where big companies can easily move profits to low tax regimes.
Today's G20 developments mark a move towards an international crackdown.
George Osborne and his French and German counterparts will be powerful advocates for change at future meetings.
But it is only a start.  And, as the chancellor has acknowledged, in a low growth climate governments need to take care not to deter multinationals who might invest in their economies.
The chancellor told BBC News: "We want a tax system that makes it competitive for businesses to set up in Britain and create jobs, but we also want a tax system where business pay their taxes and that's what we're setting up achieving here with other countries at this meeting in Moscow.
"International companies are an important source of jobs - we want them in Britain. We are making sure the taxes in Britain are low but we do expect those international companies to pay those taxes.
"The international tax laws for these companies have not really changed in decades, even though the international economy has changed a lot - people shop online, for example - and so the only way to deal with that is to work with other countries to make sure the international tax laws change and then international companies will pay their fair share of taxes."
But Labour leader Ed Miliband said: "George Osborne makes lots of promises on tackling tax avoidance, but I don't see much evidence of it.
"What he should be worrying about is the living standards of people in this country.
"Of course, he should be dealing with tax avoidance, but one of the things he's doing is cutting taxes for the richest people in society - Â£100,000 tax cut for the richest people in Britain - the wrong thing to do at a time when everyone else's living standards are squeezed."
The UK will chair a committee set up by the OECD looking at "transfer pricing" - how global firms calculate the payments passed between their subsidiaries in different countries - which can be used to shift profits from high-tax jurisdictions to lower-tax ones.
The committee is one of three looking at the tax issues which will help the OECD prepare a "plan of action" to be put forward to the G20 in July.
Germany will head a panel looking at the ways in which companies have reduced their tax base - their taxable income and assets - while France and the US will jointly consider the problem of identifying the correct tax jurisdiction for business activities, particularly e-commerce.
Mr Osborne said Britain had cut its corporation tax rate by more than any other country in the G20 over the past two years, which he said was "a message to the world that we are open for business that has seen companies return to Britain, and helping to create and secure thousands of jobs and millions in investment".
He said: "Our commitment to the most competitive corporate tax system goes hand in hand with our call for strong international standards to make sure that global companies, like anyone else, pay the taxes they owe.
"That's why Britain, with Germany and France, asked the OECD to scrutinise the international rules, and we will together welcome their report to the G20 this weekend. The report shows this is an international issue that requires international action."
The chancellor said global tax rules "have stood still for almost a century", adding that "Britain will lead the international effort to bring them into the 21st Century".
He wants to use Britain's presidency of the G8 in 2013 to push international progress on the reform of international tax rules, which were first developed by the League of Nations in the mid-1920s and remain essentially unchanged.
Response list: ["Britain's chancellor George Osborne has said he wants to tackle tax avoidance by working with other countries."]
Ground truth: Chancellor George Osborne has renewed his call for international action to tackle so-called "profit shifting" by multinational companies to avoid tax.

Costa trod on Emre Can and Martin Skrtel in a second-leg tie that saw the Londoners progress after extra time.
The Football Association is waiting on referee Michael Oliver's report before deciding on whether to take any action.
Mourinho insisted the Blues striker was blameless, claiming he was only "looking to the ball".
But Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said: "He has this edge to him. With Emre Can, that was poor, I felt."
The first-half incident involving Can took place close to the technical area and prompted an angry response from the Liverpool player.
Rodgers felt Costa could have avoided treading on his player.
"He could easily hurdle over the young player and he directs his studs right on to his ankle, which could've been nasty," said the Reds boss.
"Again, the one with Martin Skrtel, there's no need to do it. That's the sad thing. He's a top-class player and he's clever enough that the officials don't see it."
Chelsea reached the final thanks to Branislav Ivanovic's goal, although they would have progressed on away goals having drawn 1-1 at Anfield in the first leg.
But most of the post-match talk centred on Costa.
Mourinho feels the Brazil-born Spain international is being targeted unfairly, with one unnamed television pundit in particular leading the way.
"There is a campaign on the television with a certain pundit that is saying Diego Costa 'crimes'," said Mourinho. "This guy must be nuts.
"Great campaign. We know how much that pundit loves Chelsea and particularly loves me."
Mourinho declined to identify the pundit, adding: "I don't know his name, because when I see him I switch off the television."
Costa was involved in three of the game's main talking points - he also had a penalty appeal turned down when tripped by Skrtel - and could face retrospective punishment from the FA for the two alleged stamps.
If he is banned, Costa would miss Saturday's Premier League clash with second-placed Manchester City at Stamford Bridge.
In a fiery second half at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho appeared to row on the touchline with Liverpool counterpart Rodgers.
The Portuguese described himself and Rodgers as "very different people", referencing the time they worked together at Chelsea.
"I don't know if he learned something with me or not," said Mourinho. "Maybe he did, maybe he didn't."
He went on to criticise Rodgers for failing to praise Reds goalkeeper Simon Mignolet in his post-match television interviews.
"He speaks about [Chelsea keeper Thibaut] Courtois, he forgets Mignolet," said Mourinho. "I speak about Courtois and Mignolet.
"He forgets his goalkeeper. I don't forget my goalkeeper, because my goalkeeper helped me to be in the final.
"He is what he is. He is a fantastic manager, but we are different people."
Rodgers played down talk of an issue between the two managers.
"There is no problem," he said. "It's a competitive game between two top sides and the chimp comes out every now and then."
Response list: ['Chelsea striker Diego Costa has been blamed for a "nasty" penalty against Liverpool in the Premier League.']
Ground truth: Diego Costa's alleged stamps during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final win over Liverpool were "absolutely accidental", says boss Jose Mourinho.

Input: Helen Pearson, 34, suffered neck and face wounds when her neighbour Joseph Willis attacked her with scissors in an Exeter graveyard.
She had made 125 reports to Devon and Cornwall Police about Willis' stalking before the attack in 2013.
The force said its "investigation and victim care did not meet the high standards we expect".
Ms Pearson said the apology "didn't do anything" for her and said she was "still suffering every day because of what happened to me".
More on this story, and other Devon news
The stalker and the woman who refused to give in
"All I can hope is that what happened to me means police officers get more training and deal with victims of stalking better - so that no-one else has to go through what I did," she said.
Willis was jailed for life for attempted murder.
A court heard that Ms Pearson's flat and car had been targeted by Willis, abusive messages were daubed on the streets around her house and threatening letters were sent to her between 18 January 2009 and 21 October 2013, when she was attacked.
The force said its Professional Standards Department had found cases of misconduct against three officers, one of whom had retired.
There was no detail immediately available on what action was taken against the other two officers.
Two further officers did not have a case to answer, but were given "management guidance and advice".
New orders planned to give stalking protection
Alexis Bowater, former chief executive of Network for Surviving Stalking, said she was "still, sadly, getting calls from victims saying that police are not taking their complaints seriously".
"They call it murder in slow motion," she said. "Taking stalking seriously is murder prevention."
Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer had met the Pearson family and "offered a personal apology to them", the force said.
Deputy Chief Constable Paul Netherton said "numerous changes" in the force's stalking investigations had been made since the attack.
Officers were given "appropriate and regular training" and the force would "continue to strive to ensure that this type of incident is not repeated".
Response list: ['A woman who was stalked by a man who killed her in 2009 has been told she is "still suffering" after the force apologised.']

Input: Mrs Foster said that she hopes that talks on a Tory-DUP arrangement will conclude as soon as possible.
She said it should be no surprise that the DUP wants a reference to the devolution of Corporation Tax in the deal.
The Stormont Executive has long aspired to reduce its Corporation Tax rate.
Previous Northern Ireland executives have wanted to bring it down to 12.5%  to match the corresponding rate in the Irish Republic.
Previously, the Treasury has argued that Stormont would need to pay for such a move by taking a cut to its block grant from London of several hundred million pounds a year.
However, Mrs Foster told the BBC's Inside Politics programme that her party wants to explore whether that remains the case because, in the light of Brexit, they argue that European Union (EU) state aid rules should no longer apply.
The DUP leader believes there is "a very good chance" of devolution being restored at Stormont.
She pointed out that the DUP had just achieved its greatest ever election result and said the party would not countenance anything regarding Sinn FÃ©in deciding who the DUP's nominee for first minister should be.
On abortion, Mrs Foster said there is a broad swathe of consensus that the 1967 Act should not apply to Northern Ireland.
However, she said her party would go back and look at an expert report on the issue of fatal foetal abnormality which is understood to recommend legal changes.
The DUP leader noted that her party no longer has the numbers on its own to launch a petition of concern in the Stormont Assembly blocking same-sex marriage.
Asked if it would no longer seek such a veto, Mrs Foster said she would not tie her party down in relation to that matter and discussions about the Petition of Concern system were continuing between the parties.
Questioned about the DUP's relationship with loyalist paramilitaries, Mrs Foster said her party had never sought any endorsement from any group.
She repeated that she would have "no truck" with anyone engaged in paramilitarism or criminality.
Asked about the political rollercoaster which has seen her removed from office as first minister then become the Kingmaker at Westminster, Mrs Foster said she had been kept going by the support of ordinary people.
She said the mark of any politician is how they stay the course when things are tough.
On Brexit, the DUP leader said she believes high tech equipment to monitor goods crossing the Irish border will be ready in time for the UK's departure from the EU. She said developing such a capacity would involve cooperation between the private and public sectors.
Asked what she meant by a "sensible" Brexit, Mrs Foster said her party is talking to Northern Ireland's ports to see how they think trade should be handled.
Noting that 73% of goods coming through Belfast port are going to or coming from Great Britain, Mrs Foster said one thing which would not work would be a border down the middle of the Irish Sea.
Response list: ["Northern Ireland's DUP leader has said she would not allow Sinn FÃ©in to decide the next first minister."]
Ground truth: The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said it is "right and proper" that her MPs support the Conservative government's first Queen's Speech next Wednesday.

Input: Leah Bracknell starred in the ITV series, set in the Yorkshire Dales, from 1989 to 2005.
Her character was known for storylines which raised awareness about mental health and LGBT issues.
Ms Bracknell, who is now a yoga instructor, shared her diagnosis on an internet fundraising page set up to raise money for treatment in Germany.
As of Friday afternoon, more than Â£35,000 of the Â£50,000 target had been raised.
On the fundraising page 52-year-old Leah, who is known to her family as Ali, said she had been teaching yoga workshops and starting rehearsals for a comedy play before she received the news.
"It turns out that the universe had other plans. Life was about to be unexpectedly turned on its head," she said.
"I began to feel breathless climbing stairs... I just put it down to a bit of stress.
"My abdomen suddenly ballooned - and within a matter of a few days I looked heavily pregnant. I could barely walk or breathe."
After an emergency procedure to remove excess fluid from around her heart, Ms Bracknell said she was told she had stage four lung cancer, which she described as "a fairly brutal and bleak diagnosis, but one I am determined to challenge".
Her partner Jez Hughes explained the funds will be used for "immunotherapy and integrative medicine, which are seeing previously 'incurable' cancers going into complete remission".
Ms Bracknell played vet Zoe Tate, sister to Chris Tate and daughter of Frank Tate, one of the main families in the soap.
During her years on the show Zoe Tate came out as lesbian and later suffered from schizophrenia.
She made a dramatic exit when she left the village, blowing up Home Farm where the family had lived.
She won the 'Best Exit' award at the British Soap Awards in May 2006 for her performance in the scene.
It is one of the most exciting avenues of cancer treatment which uses the body's own immune system to fight off cancer.
Our immune system is like a police force, protecting us from diseases.
Normally our immune system spots and destroys faulty cells - like cancer ones - but sometimes these can escape detection and develop into tumours.
Instead of targeting the cancer cells themselves, as many traditional cancer drugs do, immunotherapy reawakens the immune system so it can "remember" the cancer and stop it in its tracks.
A number of immunotherapy treatments are already showing considerable promise.
Response list: ['A woman who was on the soap opera "The X-Files" for 20 years has been diagnosed with stage four lung cancer.']

Input: Little is known about critical care delirium, or ICU psychosis, which triggers psychological effects in patients in intensive care.
During delirium some patients believe doctors are trying to kill them, they see ghostly figures, suffer hallucinations and anxiety.
Most patients recover quickly with the correct help.
A recent study found that some 55% of people who survive intensive care treatment  go on to develop psychological disorders like depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.
Frances, who did not wish to give her surname, was in intensive care in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast for four weeks following complications during her second heart bypass.
She had never heard of critical care delirium.
"When I became aware, firstly, I had terrible hallucinations. Other patients were not in their beds, they were in pop-up cars. There were people dressed as ninjas at each side of the bed.
"I felt they were going to harm us and we had to be good. Looking back now I believed they were trying to kill us and they did it by injecting your stomach.
"On one occasion, I even hid in a cupboard to try and stop them killing me.
"When my family came to see me I was begging them to take me home and told them if they didn't take me home I would be killed that night. I started to text people and tell them to come and get me. It was worse for my family knowing I was so unhappy," she said.
"It would be reassuring for families to know that it is actually a condition and it's not just happening to you.
"You do feel very embarrassed about it and you don't want to bring it up because you feel so embarrassed."
A recent study of 157 patients at University College Hospital, in London, found high levels of depression, anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder.
Dr George Gardiner, a clinical lead at the Critical Care Network in Belfast, has been studying critical care delirium. He said the condition is not unusual.
"The symptoms are caused by the environment and the critical illness suffered. They are upsetting and unsettling for the family and friends who will also see what is going on. It is something we in the intensive care unit have been concentrating on for the last ten years," he said.
International research has been focused on trying to improve how to spot the symptoms to treat the condition and the Critical Care Network has developed a number of scoring systems to try and pick it up at the earliest stage in patients.
"There are a series of cognitive tests to see if a patient is in the zone of delirium and that is what Frances has been experiencing, a condition called critical care delirium.
"There are a number of strategies which can be used to try and normalise the environment. Introducing night and day when that can be done, reducing sedation when possible and freeing patients from the equipment. That's something that we are trying to push forward here in Northern Ireland."
Dr Gardiner explained that, by definition, a patient in intensive care has a critical condition and that it is not surprising that the brain starts to malfunction in this way.
He understands how patients can begin to slip into delirium.
"By the very nature of the monitoring we have to do and the equipment that is needed to support your organ systems night and day it can be difficult to differentiate, there can be noises, there are alarms and there is always a stranger, albeit a nurse in the room with you," he said.
"Never the less it is quite common for patients, especially the more critical patients, to lapse into delirium and sometimes it can be quite difficult to pick that up."
Dr Gardiner has been involved in trying to reduce the chances of patients suffering from delirium.
"The strategy we employ in NI is to have the patient as lightly sedated as possible and move them out of intensive care as soon as possible. We are having good success at this.
"We never get the opportunity to let people know that delirium is a common effect of being in critical care and we are looking out for it and we can treat it. Most people will make a good recovery. It might take a bit of time but patients should be assured we are on top of the issue.
"We can treat this and people will get back to normal."
Response list: ['A patient who experienced delirium after being in intensive care has been helped by a team of nurses.']
Ground truth: It is a condition which is rarely talked about and most people are too embarrassed to mention it after they recover.

Input: "Gerard Depardieu was very insistent," Thierry Fremaux told the Associated Press.
"He really wanted us to show it."
Fremaux had initially turned down United Passions, but eventually agreed to an open-air public screening on the beach.
"At the beginning I said 'Out of the question', because the film lack[ed] the quality to be part of the official selection," he said.
"Then they said, 'Why not on the beach?'. I said, 'Ah, the beach. Yes, it's a festival. It's football. It's the general public. Okay'."
Depardieu attended the screening with then-Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who recently resigned from his post amidst the corruption scandal that has engulfed world football's governing body.
Fifa largely paid for the Â£17m film out of its own coffers, only to see it mauled by the critics and flop at the US box office.
The film, in which Tim Roth plays Blatter and Depardieu plays Fifa founder Jules Rimet, went straight to DVD in France and has been released in only a handful of other countries.
However Fremaux refused to pour yet more scorn on the film, saying he did not "find the movie horrible at all".
Response list: ['French director Thierry Fremaux has refused to criticise the football documentary "United Passions" after it failed to get the top 10 of the US box office.']

Input: Supt Steve Furnham said infrastructure in Lens is "very limited" and fans should watch the game in other cities.
Welsh officers will join colleagues from England and Northern Ireland as 500,000 UK nationals head to France.
Supt Furnham also said banned fans will get a "knock on the door" if they do not surrender their passports.
A police delegation from Wales travels to Sweden with the national team for a friendly on 5 June and then on to Paris the next day.
"We are there until Wales get knocked out or win it. Hopefully the latter," South Wales Police's Supt Furnham said.
Their role will be to patrol host cities and fan zones as well as offering guidance to French police on safety, security and how to engage with Welsh fans.
Supt Furnham said officers chosen from Wales are "very experienced" who regularly work at domestic games as well as at internationals.
A total of 87 Welsh fans issued with banning orders after incidents in the UK have until Wednesday night to surrender their passports.
"The very fact they have been arrested indicates they are a risk," he said.
"We've worked really, really hard to reduce the number of arrests at games across the country. Arrests are down and we want that to continue."
With a fan zone capable of holding just 10,000 fans, a handful of bars and a ban on consuming alcohol on the streets of Lens, Supt Furnham warned ticketless Wales fans against going to the city for the game with England on 16 June.
Lens has a population of less than 40,000 and with the stadium holding just 35,000, concerns have been expressed about a large influx.
"If you haven't got a ticket to Lens, don't go," he said.
"It's been well documented in the last couple of weeks that the infrastructure doesn't lend itself to large numbers of football fans going there."
He said other cities are better equipped such as Bordeaux, where there will be a fan zone capable of hosting 60,000 people.
Response list: ['Welsh police have been asked to patrol the city of Lens in France as part of a "fan zone" for a friendly match against England.']

The gates officially opened at 08:00 BST but people reported long queues to get on to the site.
One ticket-holder told the BBC he had been in the queue for "about four and a half hours" and only moved half a mile.
"We're trying to get in the campervan field but we're glad we've come today because we think it's going to be even worse tomorrow," he said.

Others took to social media to vent their frustrations, with Angela Gibbon tweeting: "7 hours in the queue now...so near yet so far away!".
Steve Saunders posted a shot of the roadside saying: "This is a view of a hedge we've had for a hour. It's a beaut!" while Patrick Dear tweeted: "Talking about necessary survival plans now - which of us to eat first."
Mike Ross said he had "never been on a roundabout long enough to take a nap before" and Moira tweeted that she had "been in this traffic for 12 hours, that's longer than any of my relationships".
Mr Eavis said he was "sorry for the delay" but the problem was because "people were coming before the gates were open".
"We did ask people to postpone their trip by about six or seven hours but instead of that - funnily enough - more people have come early this time," he said.
"I don't mind them coming early but they're going to have to wait because we don't have the staff or the car parks until 8 o'clock in the morning."
Festival organisers earlier advised people "not to set off" yet or "grab some essentials" for the journey.
A temporary campervan and caravan holding site was set up at the Bath and West show ground near Shepton Mallet and festival-goers were advised to go there.
Avon and Somerset Police said traffic was queuing on the A37, north and south of the A361 junctions, with further congestion around the A303.
The force advised people to avoid the area "unless absolutely necessary".
Somerset County Council said traffic heading to the festival had caused widespread disruption.
It said a number of school buses had been caught up in the traffic, and were running late or not at all.
Residents described the gridlocked roads as a "traffic disaster".
Lorry driver Jason Barnes called the situation "absolute carnage" and said: "In six hours I've only driven 11 miles. I'm supposed to be working".
Nigel White said the A39 through Ashcott was "virtually at a standstill" while Judith Templeman said "no other event would be allowed to cause this level of mayhem".
"If they can't handle the influx of people in an efficient way so as not to cause this level of disruption on all the access routes around Shepton Mallet... then it should be stopped or limited to the number that can be processed efficiently," she added.
Frome MP David Warburton tweeted it had "not been so bad for years" and he would be writing to Mr Eavis as this was "not good for Somerset".
The Met Office posted a weather update on its Twitter account, saying further outbreaks of rain over Glastonbury this morning had added to the "already very wet ground conditions."
Pictures emerged on Monday showing flooding at the Somerset site, with paths under water and camping areas already turned into mudbaths.
Muse, Adele and Coldplay are all headlining the main Pyramid stage over the weekend.

Input: Chief executive Inga Beale told the BBC that Lloyd's may set up a subsidiary or branches in mainland Europe.
She estimates that 4% of revenues could be lost after Brexit because Lloyd's would lose its licence - or passporting - rights to operate across the EU.
The fallout from Brexit "is a major issue for us to deal with", she said.
Lloyd's, one of Britain's oldest institutions, is the world's leading insurance and reinsurance market and houses around 90 syndicates. It focuses on specialist markets, such as marine, energy and political risk, and this year insured the taste buds of a Cadbury's chocolate taster.
Continental Europe accounts for about 11% of gross premiums written by the London market. Ms Beale told the BBC that Lloyd's was now "focusing our attention" on maintaining its position in a post-Brexit landscape.
It had not yet been decided whether to establish branches in individual EU countries or an EU-wide subsidiary, but the latter option would probably be cheaper, she said.
But Ms Beale said Lloyd's had to respond. "It's the lack of certainty for our clients. Business cannot hang around," she said. "Boards are going to insist that they make plans [for life after Brexit]"
She did not disclose details of the size of any EU-based subsidiary or consequences for jobs, but said: "Some people may end up doing their jobs in other parts of Europe rather than in London."
Her comments came as Lloyd's reported half-year pre-tax profits of Â£1.46bn, up from Â£1.20bn for the six months last year.
Despite the rise, premiums continue to be under pressure, said Lloyd's chairman John Nelson.
He said: "Whilst we are operating in difficult conditions, we have continued to make significant progress in growing our presence in the fast-growth markets across the globe.
"In 2016 we have applied for onshore reinsurance licences in India and Malaysia as well as opening a new office in Bogota, Colombia. This complements the growth we are seeing in Dubai, China and in our more traditional markets, particularly the United States."
Response list: ['Lloyd\'s chairman Inga Beale has said the insurance giant is "focusing our attention" on maintaining its position in the UK after Brexit.']

Input: Buthelezi starred as his own great-grandfather King Cetshwayo, but could not attend the original premiere because of restrictions imposed by the apartheid government.
He was joined by Prince Harry and Welsh actor Sir Stanley Baker's widow.
The event was raising money for charities helping wounded soldiers and African children.
The screening is a digitally re-mastered version of the 1964 film starring Sir Michael Caine, which recounts the battle of Rorke's Drift in 1879, when some 150 British soldiers - many from Wales - held off around 4,000 Zulu tribesman whose land they had invaded.
Lady Ellen Baker said it would be "lovely" to see Buthelezi again.
She said: "We formed a great friendship."
Buthelezi, 85, who played his own great-grandfather in the film, has described how the set was an "oasis" where "whites and blacks could mingle without any fuss".
Lady Ellen said Sir Stanley, who took the lead role as well as co-producing the film, had been determined to treat the warrior extras in the film with respect - despite its location in apartheid South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province.
"Stanley had to be very skilful and diplomatic," said Lady Ellen, whose husband was from Ferndale, Rhondda. "It was the height of apartheid."
Funds raised at the Leicester Square Odeon screening are going to Walking with the Wounded, Sentebale and The David Rattray Memorial Trust.

The bank said they will include "advanced security features" and their designs will be unveiled in the coming months.
All four Northern Ireland banks print their own money, a tradition stretching back to the early 19th Century.
Ulster Bank's senior brand manager Lita Notte said it is "an important part of our business heritage and the economy of Northern Ireland".
The new banknotes feature designs on the theme "living in nature", influenced by a panel of historians, botanists, artists, architects and members of the public.
"The notes are in the final stages of their design phase," Ms Notte said.
"They are a unique demonstration of what matters to those who live and work here in Northern Ireland."
Earlier this year, Ulster Bank said that plastic notes will "probably be more cost-effective" than paper currency.
They are said by the Bank of England to be cleaner, safer and stronger than paper notes.
Last year, the Bank of England released its first polymer note but the first plastic £5 had been introduced 17 years previously in Northern Ireland by Northern Bank.
Ulster Bank said it will engage with retailers to help them adapt to the new polymer notes.
There is about £2.5bn worth of Northern Ireland banknotes in circulation and Ulster Bank has been producing notes for 181 years.
Existing Ulster Bank £5 and £10 notes will remain in circulation until 2019, when they will be removed.

Input: Derbyshire Cave Rescue Organisation (DCRO) was called out after three cavers failed to return from a trip into Gautries Hole, north of Buxton.
Heavy rain had caused a section of passage close to the entrance to become completely flooded, leaving the cavers with no way out.
They were rescued by the team using underwater breathing apparatus.
Bill Whitehouse, from the DCRO, said: "They were very experienced cavers who knew what had happened and what the consequences were.
"They did exactly the right thing and found somewhere to hold-up until help came."
He added: "Once they were beyond the flooded part of the cave they were quite safe - it's just they couldn't get out."
The team took the decision to "dive them out" because the water level was not going down and more heavy rain was forecast, meaning they could have remained trapped for a long period.
Mr Whitehouse said it was unusual for the cave to be totally flooded.
Response list: ['A team of cavers who had been trapped in a cave for 12 hours in the South West of England have been rescued.']

Input: Keshi said an un-named agent submitted his name without his knowledge for a job as Ivory Coast coach.
For his part Enyeama says he thought his case closed after apologising for his "uncomplimentary remarks" about security in Kaduna.
His comments came ahead of of June's Africa Cup of Nations tie against Chad.
The NFF felt his comments breached a code of conduct signed by all players earlier this year.
Keshi, who signed a new two-year deal with the NFF in April, was on a list of 59 applicants published recently by the Ivorian federation to succeed Frenchman Herve Renard.
Top NFF official Chris Green has been widely quoted in the local media as saying they may travel to Abidjan to enable them 'reach a reasonable conclusion' on the matter.
Enyeama believed his issue had already been dealt with.
"I was told to apologise for my comments, which I did immediately and they told me that's fine," Enyeama told BBC Sport.
"Personally, as it was resolved in-house I thought that was the end of the matter.
"I only received a letter to cautioning me about it [my comments] and to avoid a repeat of such."
The 32-year-old, who is the Super Eagles most capped player with 101 appearances, denies he failed to reply to messages from the NFF seeking an explanation for his comments.
"But I only found out about a disciplinary hearing in the media but I didn't get any letter to that effect," he explained.
"As the captain I only raised our concerns about the venue before our game which didn't go down well with the football authority.
The Lille player could face a lengthy ban for his comments which the NFF feels broke its recent code of conduct signed by the players as well as his failure to attend Tuesday's hearing.
The NFF executive board will have the final say on any punishments, on a date yet to be decided.
It has also been confirmed that the Super Eagles will play their next home 2017 Nations Cup qualifier against Egypt in Kaduna next March.
Response list: ['NFF officials have said they will not take action against a former captain of the Ivory Coast national team over his comments about security at a football match.']

Input: Rose, 36, was level with Stenson on 15 under par after 17 holes but the Swede bogeyed the last while Rose sank a birdie putt to win by two shots.
The 2013 US Open champion hit a four-under-par 67 to win on 16 under.
Open champion Stenson took silver with a 68, while American Matt Kuchar carded a 63 to claim bronze on 13 under.
"That felt better than anything I've ever won," said Rose.
"It was the best tournament I've ever done. Hopefully we've shown Brazil what golf is about. I'm glad it was close. Not for my nerves, for golf."
While several other high-profile golfers had decided not to compete at the Olympics, Rose had relished the prospect of becoming an Olympian since the moment the sport's return to the Games was confirmed in 2009.
Such was his eagerness to be part of the experience, he arrived the week before the Olympics officially started to ensure he was part of the opening ceremony.
The Englishman made history by hitting Olympic golf's first hole-in-one in the opening round and started Sunday with a one-shot lead, before shooting four birdies and just one bogey on his outward nine.
Stenson carded birdies in four of his first 10 holes and drew level with Rose when the leader dropped a shot on the 13th.
It looked like a play-off would be needed to separate them but Rose held his nerve on the par-five last, chipping his approach to two feet from the hole, while Stenson's spun away to around 20 feet.
The Swede then raced his birdie putt eight feet past the hole and missed the return to allow Rose the luxury of two putts for victory. He needed just the one.
Former world number one Tiger Woods: "Thrilled for Rosie, Henrik & Kuch, but all golfers in Rio this week should be proud."

Input: The app-based car-hire service joins rivals Grab and GoJek, who already have established similar services.
Thousands of taxi drivers protested recently in the Indonesian capital against transport apps.
The drivers said ride-hailing apps such as Uber have made it impossible for them to earn a living in the city.
Uber started operating in Jakarta in the later part of 2014. The car-hire service also operates in other Indonesian cities - Bandung, Surabaya and the popular tourist destination Bali.
It is calling its latest offering "uberMOTOR", which it claims will allow anyone in Jakarta to "push a button and get a motorbike ride in minutes".
The company says its pricing is the "most affordable" in town, with a base fare starting at 1,000 Indonesian rupiah ($0.08; Â£0.06).
Earlier this year, thousands of cab drivers in Paris also staged a protest, against competition from app-based taxi services including Uber.
The Uber service is available in 380 cities around the world. The company has said it is profitable in the US. But in China, Uber is losing $1bn a year. And that is partly due to fierce competition.
Response list: ['UberMOTOR, a Jakarta-based ride-hailing service, has been launched in Indonesia.']
Ground truth: Uber has launched a motorbike taxi service in Jakarta, to offer commuters an alternative for getting around the usually congested Indonesian capital.

Input: Hughes has been out ever since suffering concussion in the match against Cardiff Blues on 12 August.
"The recovery process following head injuries is well-documented," said Dragons backs coach Shaun Connor.
"You can't afford to rush players back, and that's what you'd expect from your medical staff as well."
Wing or centre Hughes, who is in his second spell with the Gwent region following time at Exeter Chiefs, is likely to feature in the 23 to face the Russian side Enisei-STM in the European Challenge Cup.
Despite the long absence, Connor told BBC Wales Sport that 26-year old Hughes' future had not been in doubt.
"Never, it's always a long process and Adam always had the intention of fighting his way back to fitness," he said.
His return comes amid controversy over the introduction of tougher World Rugby guidelines issued to referees on dealing with high tackles, in an effort to reduce the number of concussions.
Scarlets lock Jake Ball and Ospreys fly-half Sam Davies were both yellow-carded in the first round of PRO12 matches since the changes in interpretation.
Dragons flanker Nic Cudd, who is often among his team's leading tacklers, hopes the change will not affect them because of their tackling style.
"All the boys are aware of it, we saw the Scarlets highlights and it's being refereed in a different way," he said.
"We've got to be careful but on the whole we're a leg-tackling team so hopefully it shouldn't affect us too much.
"They are being strict with it so we've got to keep away from that shoulder-up area, but if anything the new laws should suit us. If it improves player safety, I'm all for it."
Response list: ["Adam Hughes has been out of action for the Scarlets' first PRO12 match since his head injury."]
Ground truth: Newport Gwent Dragons three-quarter Adam Hughes is fit for a comeback five months after a head injury in a pre-season friendly.

Input: The only failsafe answer of course is not to talk about politics at all.
But it's a very real question that the prime minister faces right now. He says ministers who want to campaign to leave the EU will be able to do so in the runup to the vote.
But on this subject, that has so divided the Conservatives in the past, how can he stop what will be an energetic debate in the party doing lasting damage?
The Downing Street headed notepaper, the clarifications of parliamentary precedent, and the careful words all look terribly polite.
But in David Cameron's three-page letter to his ministers this afternoon, there are some robust messages to his own side, and evidence of his own anxieties about the self-harm the Conservatives could indulge in during the coming months.
It was only last week that he succumbed to the (almost) inevitable and said that ministers will be able to vote according to their beliefs, and campaign to leave the EU in the referendum. But the PM clearly believes the decision alone is not enough. So, to try to rein people in, he's published a set of rules.
First off, in no uncertain terms, ministers are told to keep quiet on the subject until he reaches a deal, expected in the middle of next month.
But even after the negotiations are complete, the letter states that ministers will only be able to give their overall positions on the basic question, stay or go.
He writes "all other EU or EU-related businessâ€¦will continue to be subject to the normal rules of collective responsibility".
So, a row between the Home Office and Brussels over a new European regulation?  A spat between DEFRA and the EU about environmental regulations?
Under David Cameron's rules, Eurosceptic government ministers would not be allowed to use evidence from normal government business to make the case to leave.
And ministers who want to leave the EU won't be able to use the power, the drama of Westminster itself to argue for exit.
Number 10 will not allow Eurosceptics with jobs in the government to campaign for Out from the backbenches, nor will they be allowed to speak at length on the issue from the despatch box.
If they are asked a question by an MP that requires them to make reference to an EU issue, they will be able to point out their own position, while also referring to the government policy.
But that's as far as it goes, whereas the prime minister, and those who are expected to campaign to stay will be able to argue for the government position, almost inevitably making the case to stay.
Tonight, it's prompted accusations there simply is one rule for one side, another for the other. Campaigners for Out are gleefully pointing out tonight that ministers are being given less licence to express their views than Liberal Democrat ministers were under the coalition.
The civil service won't be neutral, and will support the government's position "in the normal way".
Eurosceptic cabinet ministers I've spoken to are relatively relaxed about the suggestions, but with one important caveat, that the prime minister does not use the immediate aftermath of the summit where he agrees the deal, to hail it as a huge breakthrough before they are allowed to make their case.
With summits finishing on Friday afternoons, and the Cabinet traditionally meeting on Tuesday mornings, there are nerves about a vital 72-hour gap where the campaign to stay could suddenly have huge advantage.
Most telling perhaps is what the letter tells us about the political dangers of this project, probably the biggest risk David Cameron has ever taken.
He calls for Conservative ministers to remain a "united, harmonious, mutually respectful team".
The fact he feels the need to spell that out suggests just how worried he may be about polite disagreement descending into bitterness.
Response list: ['The prime minister has written a letter to his ministers, warning that they will be given less freedom to campaign for or against leaving the EU.']
Ground truth: How do you stop a polite conversation about politics, even with your nearest and dearest, descending into a slanging match?

Input: Shropshire Fire Service was called to The Mill Hotel in Alveley, near Bridgnorth, shortly after 05:00 BST.
Area manager John Das-Gupta said the blaze had "compromised the integrity of the building".
The service said it received numerous calls alerting it to the fire "due to smoke being visible from a number of miles away".
The Shropshire service sent 11 fire engines and was supported by firefighters from across the region, including from Staffordshire, the West Midlands and Hereford and Worcester.
An investigation has begun into the cause of the blaze.
Earlier, area manager Andy Johnson said the fire involved "the whole of the building", which covers three floors.
Because of the scale of the blaze crews were expected to remain at the site through Monday night.
Neil Griffiths from the fire service said crews were unable to get into the building itself because of its fragile state. A structural engineer is on site.
The Mill Hotel, which was a popular wedding venue, closed unexpectedly last September as a result of the financial problems of its owner, Elysian Care..
The building dated back to the 16th Century and was once a working flour mill, according to Visit Heart of England.
The 41-bedroom hotel had been "carefully restored and extended" with many of the original features maintained, the tourist information website said.
Response list: ['A fire at a hotel in Shropshire has caused a major disruption to the area.']

Input: Media playback is not supported on this device
Scot Anderson, 44, led the match 3-0 but, with Lewis suffering "disgraceful" abuse, allowed the Englishman to reel off eight legs in a row to secure an 8-3 victory.
When asked if he intentionally lost, Anderson told BBC Scotland: "Yes.
"I didn't want to win a game where that happened; I thought it was a disgrace."
Anderson subsequently issued a statement on social media, saying he "would never intentionally lose a match".
Lewis, 30, had beer thrown at him during his entrance to the arena, and coins were thrown onto the stage during the match.
"It was bad that night," said Anderson, who beat Lewis 10-4 in the final two months later.
"I'm a proud Scotsman but when that happened, it sickened me. Aidy is a good friend of mine. It was terrible."
Anderson said it was not "right" for him to win the game.
He added: "If I'm going to play a game, I'm going to play it right. With them doing that, Aidy couldn't play with that going on."
Anderson, who beat Phil Taylor in January's PDC World Championship final, says abuse of that magnitude is something he rarely encounters on the darts circuit.
"I play all over the world and I had never seen it before," he added.
"It cheesed me off. I don't know why it happened, and I hope it will never happen again."
Response list: ['Scot Anderson says he "would never intentionally lose a match" after losing to a Scottish darts player who was beaten with "disgraceful" abuse.']

Rochdale took the lead twice in the first half only for Peterborough to peg them back.
Andy Cannon volleyed the opener eight minutes in, firing through a crowded penalty area to beat Ben Alnwick in the Posh goal.
Shaquile Coulthirst threatened the Dale goal on a couple of occasions before Marcus Maddison raced onto Hayden White's pass down the right flank and fired wide of Lillis for the equaliser.
Dale were back in front in the 31st minute when Jermaine Anderson clipped Joe Rafferty's heels and Ian Henderson slammed the resulting spot-kick straight down the middle of Alnwick's goal.
But the visitors were quick to restore parity, Chris Forrester blasting a fierce drive past Lillis from 25 yards.
After an evenly contested second period Posh won it late when Lillis spilled Taylor's cross and Edwards headed into the unguarded net.

Input: Barrett finished on 114, the highest score by a Northants number 10, to back up the contributions of Crook and Rob Keogh (154) as the visitors made 551.
But Worcestershire then responded well in the day's final session.
Daryl Mitchell (86*) and Tom Fell (61*) were both there at the close on 153-1.
So far, the pair have shared an unbroken stand of 145 - matching Northants' ninth-wicket partnership earlier between Crook and Barrett.
Inside 34 overs, they fell just nine runs short of the county's ninth-wicket record, but they still surpassed the previous best for the ninth wicket in matches against Worcestershire, the 137 shared by Jack Timms and Reg Partridge at Stourbridge in 1934.
Crook's career-best 145 overtook his 142 not out last summer against the Australian tourists, while South African Barrett's innings beat the 106 by Gus Williamson, batting at 10 against Cambridge University in 1960.
On a day when Worcestershire vice-captain Joe Leach (3-121) passed the landmark of 50 Championship wickets for the second successive season, the home side lost England Lions all-rounder Brett D'Oliveira for an 11th-ball duck.
But captain Mitchell then weighed in with his best score of the summer, well supported by Fell, before bad light ended play prematurely.
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"Anyone coming in at number 10 and getting a hundred has done a great job. Jack Shantry has done that sort of thing for us.
"It is a flat wicket and our two guys played really well, Tom Fell and Daryl Mitchell, who is nicely poised for what could be his first century of the season.
"They have just started to get the ball to reverse a little bit and that will be a little bit trickier. We need to get a big score and potentially pull out if we avoid the follow-on.
"But that's easier said than done. We've got to get there. We've got nearly another 300 runs to go and that is ultimately our plan at the moment."
Northants century-maker Chad Barrett told BBC Radio Northampton:
"I couldn't have wished for a better Championship debut. I've had to wait two years for my opportunity. It was a decent wicket and I had to make the most of it.
"Two years waiting to play a second first-class game (the first was against Sri Lanka) is a long time. You think to yourself 'Am I going to play another one?'
"When I got the nod, I thought when I have a bat or a bowl, I've just got to show what I can do.
"We said we'd try to get to 500 which is a big milestone and to get to three figures myself was my own milestone. I had faith in Ben Sanderson while I got there. I know he can hold a bat and is more than capable."
Response list: ["Northants' Daryl Mitchell and Tom Fell have scored a century in the Championship, the highest for a first-class team."]
Ground truth: Northamptonshire tailender Chad Barrett made an unbeaten century on his debut, to back up Steven Crook's career-best 145 as Worcestershire were made to toil for a second day running at New Road.

Input: The farmers say the land is being taken away before compensation is agreed.
Traffic in central Delhi was gridlocked for hours as they were addressed by opposition politicians.
The use of land for industrial purposes is hugely controversial in India - protests have stalled similar projects elsewhere in the country.
The government in Uttar Pradesh state has bought the farmers' land to build an eight-lane highway and business zone between Delhi and Agra, an important industrial centre that is also home to the Taj Mahal and other popular tourist sites.
Earlier this month, three farmers in the state were killed when police fired at protesters demanding more compensation.
The BBC's Mark Dummett, who was at the protest in Delhi, says the project is exactly the kind of large-scale development that India needs to create more jobs, but the farmers say they stand to lose out.
Hundreds of millions of other Indians feel the same way, our correspondent says, and will not let land their families have farmed for hundreds of centuries be handed over easily or cheaply as the country rushes to industrialise.
"When our land is taken away, where will we live, where will our children live? They're trying to grab our land!" said one farmer at the protest.
"We haven't agreed on the compensation amount, and our lands have already been transferred to private companies!"
Another protester accused the government of trying to acquire the land cheaply.
"It's our heritage, our livelihood. When we don't have our land, what will we do - become a Maoist or a terrorist?"
India's governing Congress party says it hopes to push through a new law soon guaranteeing higher levels of compensation for farmers who lose their land.
Response list: ["A protest in Delhi over a government project to build a highway and business zone on farmers' land has been held for more than 10 hours."]

She started poorly in the Spanish capital as Konta broke serve twice to take the opening set but then fought back to claim a tie-break in the second having been 5-4 down.
And she showed the same battling qualities in the decider, fighting back from three break points that would have given Konta a 4-0 lead to win the game and subsequently the match.

Jackson killed Gill Ellis in Burnley in 1984, when he was a teenager, by stamping on her stomach and tearing a main blood vessel to her heart.
He was jailed in March 1986, went on the run in 1997 and was later freed but then recalled to Sudbury Prison.
Ms Ellis, from Burnley, was mugged as she walked across Hargher Clough Recreation Ground on her way home from a Christmas party in 1984, the Lancashire Telegraph reported.
As she lay unconscious, Jackson, also from Burnley, stamped on her stomach - splitting her pancreas and fracturing her ribs, the trial at Manchester Crown Court heard.
The prosecutor said Ms Ellis's liver had "virtually exploded".
Jackson was found guilty of murder and jailed for life.
In 1997, he escaped from HMP Ranby, in Nottinghamshire, and went on the run for three days before giving himself up after he was spotted.
He was released in 2007 - after serving 21 years of his sentence - but was later recalled to Sudbury Prison.
Police have described him as white, 6ft 4ins tall, slim, with short cropped grey hair and a tattoo on his wrist. His last known addresses was in Oldham and Burnley.

Input: Chirp was launched in 2012. It's an application that allows you to transfer files between devices simply using an audio signal. It was instantly appealing - and best of all it was the work of a British inventor, Patrick Bergel, from University College London.
Bergel and his team had big ambitions, seeing Chirp as a whole new platform for exchanging anything from photos and video to cash. At the time I wrote: "This may be an app that just proves a passing craze - but how inspiring to meet a British start-up with such Californian ambitions."
Three years on they have made some modest progress, running experiments with retailers using the app to send marketing messages, but it's fair to say this is still a brilliant idea rather than a proven business. Then today another company which also has plenty of Californian ambitions moved onto the same territory.
That business is Google, which has launched a plug-in for its Chrome browser called Google Tone. The idea is that nearby computers can share links by opening a Chrome tab, then sending out an audio signal. It's very similar to what Chirp does, although for now it has more limited applications.
That might seem like curtains for the tiny British venture, which has just embarked on a crowdfunding drive, using the Crowdcube platform to raise the modest amount of  money it needs to get to the next stage. But Patrick Bergel says the opposite is the case.
"I've been going on about 'the internet of sound' for a while, so we definitely see this as validation. Competition is a good thing." Until now, he has struggled to get London investors to back Chirp, explaining tactfully that they are "not always as open to brand new ideas as Californian venture capitalists".
It seems there is an appetite in the UK for me-too businesses - another social network or photo sharing app - but a reluctance to put money into original British technology.  But now Bergel thinks he might get a better hearing: "If you're the only person in the marketplace it's hard to convince people that it's a good thing."
What is more, Chirp had been on the point of releasing its own Chrome plug-in. Having heard about Google's Tone, it has rushed it out this morning, and says its version does more, allowing you to send all sorts of links, pictures even phone numbers from websites to another device.
What happens next will tell us something about how the UK has come as a place to launch a new technology business. If Google's hunch is right, sharing files via an audio signal is an idea whose time has come. Venture capitalists should be beating a path to Patrick Bergel's door to find out about the internet of sound. But if he wants a hearing, maybe he'd be better off heading to California.

"The club has dealt with it internally. He has admitted and apologised that he was bang out of order."
Grayson left Preston for Sunderland in June, with the task of reviving a club relegated from the Premier League last season.
The Black Cats start the 2017-18 Championship season against Derby on Friday.
Jermain Defoe, Jordan Pickford and Fabio Borini have all left the Stadium of Light, while the Black Cats have brought in more modest recruits such as Aiden McGeady, James Vaughan and Jason Steele for the challenge ahead.
"There isn't a great deal of money to spend," Grayson added. "We've got a decent enough budget but it's still way short of a lot of other clubs around us.
"The players we've brought in so far haven't been significant signings compared to the rivals who have come down spending huge amounts of money.
"What I'm trying to do with (chief executive) Martin Bain is get the club some stability, where they don't have to spend millions of pounds, and that they can do it on a lesser budget than Sunderland have been used to.
"We're trying to bring some pride back to the area and the club. Over the past few years it's been in a dark place and mismanaged."

Input: In Rhyl, Denbighshire - one of the worst-hit areas - evacuees are being cared for at the town's leisure centre, and 400 properties are without power.
Many were ferried to safety by the RNLI and emergency services.
Another high tide is expected in the area just after midnight, but serious flooding is not expected.
Thursday's storm hit the coastline about lunchtime causing major disruption with roads closed, schools shut and trains stopped.
Two severe warnings - suggesting there was a danger to life - had been issued for the area earlier on Thursday.
In Rhyl, one of the worst affected areas, a rest centre has been set up at the leisure centre for residents and schoolchildren forced to leave buildings because of the tidal surge.
At one point, up to 400 people were being cared for there, but about 90 remained by Thursday evening.
Denbighshire council said 400 properties were without power, in addition to the homes that had been affected by flooding.
At least 25 residents and six dogs were rescued and two inshore lifeboats manned by RNLI crews and assisted by the fire service ferried people to safety from flooded bungalows in Rhyl.
At the height of the flooding, the fire service dealt with 34 flood related calls in a four hour period.
By Chris DeardenBBC Wales News
Most of the flood water in Kinmel Bay, Conwy, has receded, though the local Asda car park is still under water, and water surrounds a nursing home like a moat.
But it's the possibility of further flooding this evening which is now worrying residents as the light begins to fade.
Supermarket staff are busy reinforcing the front doors with sandbags on both sides, and on the seafront, council workers are placing concrete blocks against the flood gates to make sure they hold.
One resident, Kieran Jones (pictured above), has even bricked up his own doorway to give extra protection.
A builder by trade, he said: "I used rapid hardening cement so it will set before any flood waters arrive this evening.
"It was quite scary to see the flood waters coming towards the house this morning.
"We were lucky they didn't get inside the house earlier, but I don't want to take any chances tonight."
Red Cross volunteers were also helping in Rhyl, sending 4x4 vehicles to help with evacuations.
All of the flood warnings were lifted across north Wales at about 16:00 GMT including the highest state of alert at Greenfield, Bagillt and Point of Ayr.
Earlier, people living near the River Dee at Saltney, Flintshire said they could not remember the river being so high and several cars were caught in the flood water.
A BBC reporter at Talacre, Flintshire said the area was "like a ghost town an hour and a half after the evacuation.
"The Dee estuary is bubbling away like a broth."
There were reports that the defences had broken.
During the height of the storm, scaffolding being used in roof repairs at an Aldi store in Mold, Flintshire, collapsed onto cars in high winds.
An Aldi spokesperson said: "Although nobody was hurt in the incident, we immediately evacuated the store."
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) had warned that high tides and gale force winds could "cause sea surges at their highest levels for the last 10 years, possibly 20 years".
Strong winds of between 60-70mph (97-113km/h) had been reported on the Llyn peninsula on Thursday morning.
The NRW had urged people to keep away from sea fronts and said emergency response workers were at "key sites".
Roads in Wrexham were also affected by fallen trees. Emergency teams went to Ruabon, Johnstown and Wrexham bypass, among other areas.
Flintshire Bridge which straddles the Dee at Connah's Quay was closed.
Meanwhile, Virgin Trains stopped services between Chester and Holyhead.
And Arriva Trains Wales said some of its services had  been hit.
The flooding was caused by a storm surge from a combination of low pressure and winds of up to 70 mph, causing water to pile high.
At high tide, the sea level rose by at least a metre above usual levels.
The highest wind speed was 77mph inland at Capel Curig in Conwy.
Elsewhere, a 50 tonne tree fell on top of a car, blocking the A40 near Crickhowell, Powys.
Those inside were taken to hospital Dyfed-Powys Police said they are not believed to be seriously injured.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We are in contact with the UK Government on the general situation, and with Natural Resources Wales and responder agencies in Wales on conditions in North Wales."
The Met Office expects the worst of Thursday's weather to hit north and west Scotland and parts of north and eastern England, and has issued an amber "be prepared" warning.

Input: Murphy lost to Stuart Bingham in last year's final but gained revenge with a 10-9 Grand Prix win in Llandudno.
The 33-year-old was 2005 world champion and is keen to win snooker's biggest tournament, which starts in Sheffield next month.
"I got to within three frames of winning last year, let's see if I can go three better this year," he said.
"I think if I can prepare in the same way as I did last year and continue doing the right things that I think I'm doing with my coach and my team, then I arrive in Sheffield in great form and good nick," he said.
"It doesn't mean you're going to win - it doesn't mean you're going to win your first match. But I'll give myself the best possible chance."
Murphy won his sixth ranking event, and his first in two years, by beating Bingham in north Wales and he was delighted to bring what he described as a "slump" to an end.
"I had a fantastic year in 2015 - victory in the Masters, nearly winning the world title and nearly winning the German Masters as well but nothing quite beats taking trophies home," he said.
"That's what we play for. That's what it's all about. No-one comes for second place.
"It's very difficult winning ranking tournaments. With three events left of the season it really points to good things for me "

Input: Li Heping was sentenced in a closed-door trial, Chinese state media say.
He has defended other prominent lawyers, including Chen Guangcheng and Gao Zhisheng, as well as practitioners of the banned Falun Gong movement.
A representative of campaign group Amnesty International questioned the validity of the allegations against Li.
The lawyer was detained in 2015 as part of a wider government crackdown on dissent under President Xi Jinping.
His trial took place on Tuesday in the Tianjin City Number Two Intermediate People's Court and concerned state secrets, the court said on its Weibo social media account.
In its ruling, the court said that since 2008 Li had used social media and foreign media to "smear and attack state organs and the legal system".
It also said he had used foreign funds to "interfere in high-profile cases" and colluded with several people "harbouring subversive ideas", including lawyers and those "involved in illegal religious activities".
His jail sentence had been suspended for four years and he would be denied his political privileges, the court said.
The suspension means Li could be released imminently, although it is unclear whether he has been. His time spent in detention should also count towards his jail sentence.
Amnesty International's China researcher, Patrick Poon, said that holding the trial in secret showed allegations against Li were "groundless and weak".
Wang Qiaoling has not seen her husband for the best part of two years but, like a number of other wives of the lawyers detained in July 2015, she has been a tireless campaigner for justice.
Despite the risks, she has continued to conduct media interviews about the lack of due process in the case against her husband.
The suspended prison sentence, announced without warning, will on the one hand be a relief because it ought to mean that Li will now be released. But it will also almost certainly mark the beginning of another long period of surveillance and control for the family.
Ms Wang has already refused a request from the authorities to travel to Tianjin to meet her husband, insisting instead that he should come home to her.
"He is not free, the authority wants to keep controlling him, that's why the authority tried to take me to Tianjin to meet my husband to legitimise their unjust means," she told the BBC.
Response list: ['A Chinese lawyer who was arrested in 2015 for "smear and attack state organs" has been held in a closed trial in Tianjin.']
Ground truth: One of China's best-known human rights lawyers has been given a three-year suspended jail term for subverting state power.

An RBS spokesperson said the breakdown had "minimal customer impact".
It said the problems affected "a small number of people" conducting higher value and international transactions.
The problems started at 7.45am and were resolved by 9.15am, the bank said.
On Thursday, the bank was fined £56m by UK regulators over its huge systems crash in 2012, when 6.5 million customers - equivalent to 10% of the UK population - faced problems that lasted in some cases several weeks.
Also on Friday Barclays online customers experienced some difficulties with their service for a short time.  A Barclays spokesperson told the BBC: "Barclays online banking service was unavailable for around an hour earlier today.
"All other services were up and running as usual during this time however we apologise to those customers that were impacted.  We are currently investigating what caused this to prevent it happening again."

Input: The five worshippers alleged they were segregated from the main prayer hall as they could not observe the custom of sitting cross-legged on the floor.
One woman said the screening felt like a "prison". Members accused the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara of discrimination.
A settlement was reached and the screens had already come down, the gurdwara said.
See more stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country here
The terms of the settlement were approved during a hearing at Birmingham County Court on Monday.
Bosses of the gurdwara have agreed to remove all partitions within weeks and will install a lift to the first floor prayer room.
The five claimants included Bhupinder Kaur Chohan.
She said: "The screening was like you were in a prison. On one side you've done something wrong; people [will] catch what you've got. That's how we felt."
Malkit Singh, who has cerebral palsy, said the segregation had been "very hard" and had "upset" him.
Rajinder Singh Basi, chair of Sikh Forum Wolverhampton, described the result as a "victory".
"Disabled people are not second class citizens and deserve enjoyment of the same right to worship and attend gurdwaras as everyone else," he said.
"Now the gurdwara must make changes and we look forward to them doing so," Mr Basi added.
A statement on behalf of the gurdwara said: "In reaching this amicable settlement, the gurdwara would want to send the message that all are welcome with open hands and that the gurdwara would continue to address the needs of the aged, frail and the disabled in accordance with the guidance provided by Sikh Council UK."
Response list: ['A Sikh gurdwara in Birmingham has settled a dispute over segregation of disabled worshippers.']

Input: As they prepare to go to the polls on Sunday for the second time in six months, only 3% put the need for a new administration among the country's top-priority issues, according to public pollster CIS.
The four main parties failed to reach a deal after December's inconclusive vote and there is little sign that things will change.
For Spaniards, though, a 21% rate of unemployment unsurprisingly remains the main concern.
There are signs that economic confidence is recovering as Spain emerges from the 2008-2013 double-dip recession known here as "la crisis".
First-quarter figures for 2016 show GDP growth of 0.8%, the same as during the second half of last year, mainly thanks to a 0.9% rise in consumer spending.

King calls new vote amid deadlock
Spain's 'usual suspects' line up for fresh poll
Podemos bangs on doors of power
They may embrace this partial economic recovery but Spain's voters are not crediting the conservative Popular Party (PP), which claims to have brought it about.
The PP, now a caretaker government, saw its support plummet from 45% at the height of the 2011 election to 29% on 20 December 2015.
It was enough to finish first but not to secure majority support. In the subsequent four-month lifetime of modern Spain's shortest parliament, the second-placed Socialists (PSOE) ruled out a grand coalition with the PP while negotiating a deal with the fourth-largest party, Ciudadanos (Citizens).
But repeat elections were inevitable when third-placed anti-austerity party Podemos refused to approve the deal.

Opinion polls suggests little is likely to change on 26 June, although Podemos is now eyeing second place ahead of the Socialists, largely because of a coalition deal with the United Left, an amalgam of communists and other leftists.
In Sunday's Metroscopia poll published by newspaper El Pais, the PP led on 29%, Unidos Podemos had 26%, PSOE 20.5% and Ciudadanos 14.5%.
Who would make deals with whom to form a majority was a big question for the only TV debate this month ahead of the vote.
But while all four leaders were adamant they understood that Spanish patience had worn thin, they gave little away.
So with only a month of negotiating time available before Spain's traditional summer shutdown period in August, the prospect of a lost year in politics looms ever larger.
Belgium's record of 541 days without a renewed government may still be a way off, but the brinkmanship of Spanish politicians could have disastrous consequences.
"It does look like no-one wants to make a deal with anyone," says Pablo Simon, a politics professor at Madrid's Carlos III University. "But I think this is basically down to electoral strategy because all the parties accept that there simply cannot be another election."
Mr Simon argues that decisions are needed to prevent a drop in public investment and to incorporate new spending cuts demanded by the European Commission into the 2016 budget, hurriedly passed by the PP in parliament last autumn.
According to the president of Seopan, which represents Spain's construction industry, the building sector is heading towards a ninth successive year in crisis on the evidence of the first quarter of the year without a government.
"Investment in construction and infrastructure will fall by between 15% and 18% in 2016," Julian Nunez told a conference in Santander last week.
Beyond the delicate economic circumstances, Mr Simon also warns of the dangerous potential for political disaffection if urgently needed reforms to boost employment, improve education and crack down on corruption are not forthcoming.
"If the current blockage continues and the economic situation and inequality worsen, we could reach a point where we find that Spain is not immune to the emergence of the far right," he says, noting that only Spain, Portugal and Ireland have so far been unaffected by the rise of extremist politics among European nations this century.
Popular Party Acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said the party with the most seats in Congress should be allowed to govern. His PP will again propose a broad coalition with PSOE and Ciudadanos. But the Socialists are not interested and Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera says Mr Rajoy should step aside first because of the string of PP corruption scandals that emerged while he has been leader.
Socialists Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez risks a shocking reverse if his historical party of the left is surpassed by Podemos. Polls suggest that together, Unidos Podemos and PSOE may scrape a majority or come very close. But Mr Sanchez and Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias have become bitter political enemies after the latter effectively dynamited any chance of an understanding earlier this year by insisting on an independence referendum in Catalonia, anathema to the Socialists. Mr Sanchez may have an unpalatable choice to make: be the junior partner in coalition with Unidos Podemos or allow the PP to stay in power.
Unidos Podemos The left-wing coalition wants an end to austerity politics and a massive investment in public services, as well as a minimum income guarantee for all households. This would be funded by significant tax rises for the rich and for companies. However, Mr Iglesias has hinted that a Catalonia referendum might not be a red line, a shift that would pile pressure on the Socialists to join a coalition.
Ciudadanos The anti-corruption centrist party has signed regional deals with both the PSOE and PP at a regional level, in return for a commitment to greater transparency. And leader Albert Rivera's February deal with Pedro Sanchez was a coup for Ciudadanos. But if the Socialists fade further in the polls, Mr Rivera may feel he is better served pushing for a deal with the PP, without Rajoy at its head.
Response list: ["Spain's voters are unlikely to see a second election in six months, according to a poll by the Spanish political magazine Seopan."]
Ground truth: Spaniards appear to have grown used to the idea of not having a government.

Input: The Super Eagles landed in Zambia barely 22 hours before their 2018 World Cup qualifier on 9 October after financial problems delayed the squad.
Nigeria, captained by Mikel, won Olympic bronze despite arriving just hours before their first match in Manaus because of transport issues.
"I don't think anything can beat the problems that we faced at the Olympics. I don't think any team or country can go through what we went through in Brazil and perform the way we did," Mikel told BBC Sport.
"I think it's a miracle [their unorthodox journey to Olympic football bronze] and I don't think it will ever happen again.
"To arrive at a tournament a couple of hours before your first game and still end up with a medal was an outstanding team performance.
"I wouldn't say it's the same problem [arriving on match day] we are facing now, but it is still the same issues that need to be sorted out," said Mikel.
Three-time African champions Nigeria are top of Group B in their qualifying race for Russia after a hard-fought 2-1 win in Zambia.
But Mikel, who made a scoring debut for his country at the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations against Zimbabwe, believes hitch-free preparations will boost their chances of clinching the group's sole ticket.
"For us to succeed we need to put things in place as early as possible and let the players focus on football, and not dealing with issues like flight and other things off the pitch," he said.
"This is where my experience comes in and make sure I keep the team together. I don't let whatever is happening outside distract the team," Mikel added.
Pay rows have often surrounded Nigerian teams with players boycotting training at major tournaments over unpaid bonuses.
As the most experienced player in the current squad with 72 appearances, Mikel is keen to avert such an embarrassing situation.
"I try to take in all the problems, I deal with it myself and I only speak to the players when there is good news.
"I'm sure that's what they always want to hear from me, I listen to them, we make decisions together - at the end of the day I have to have a final say on what we have to do.
"Sometimes you only need one voice, with a single voice I think everything goes smoothly.
"With the experience that I have, I will make sure whatever is happening off the pitch doesn't affect us in these qualifiers."
Olympic bronze medallist winner, Mikel has played for Nigeria at four Africa Cup of Nations tournaments in 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2013.
He won the 2013 Nations Cup title in South Africa and was a member of the team that reached the second round at the 2014 World Cup.

Input: The education, health, home affairs and business committee chairmen want PSHE, which covers sex education, made statutory in primaries and secondaries.
In a letter to Nicky Morgan, they express concern at her failure to respond to various committees' calls.
The government is working on a way to achieve high-quality PSHE for all.
It published guidelines on sex and relationship education (SRE) in 2015.
While PSHE education is not part of the statutory national curriculum, which means there is no national programme of study for the subject, the Department for Education say schools should teach it to pupils.
Schools are also required to have a policy on sex and relationship education which is made available to parents, and for inspection, which must set out how this is provided, monitored and evaluated..
It must also include information about parents' right to withdraw their children from sex education classes.
The chairmen's letter said: "We write to express our disappointment with your response so far to the issue of the statutory status for PSHE and sex and relationships education in schools.
"PSHE is a crucial part of preparing young people for life. It can provide them with the knowledge and confidence to make decisions which affect their health, well-being and relationships, now and in the future.
"It can develop the skills and attributes needed to secure employment and can help protect young people from abuse in many forms."
In February 2015, the education committee called for the DfE to "develop a work plan for introducing age-appropriate PSHE and SRE as statutory subjects in primary and secondary schools, setting out its strategy for improving the supply of teachers able to deliver this subject and a timetable for achieving this".
In January 2015, the Joint Committee on Human Rights said it would be better if schools were "required broadly to teach the same curriculum in PSHE" and that this should include issues in relation to violence against women and girls.
Six months earlier, the Home Affairs Committee called for PSHE, covering education about female genital mutilation in high prevalence areas, to be made compulsory.
And both the Children's Commissioner for England and the Chief Medical Officer made their own calls to make the subject statutory.
A Department for Education spokesman said it wanted all young people to leave school equipped with a curriculum for life that prepares them to succeed in modern Britain and the teaching of PSHE was central to that plan.
"We are working with head teachers and other experts to understand how best to achieve high-quality PSHE for every pupil," he said.
The spokesman added that PSHE was not yet good enough in many schools, adding the department had committed to looking further at this issue and examining all the options to ensure the subject was taught to a high standard in all schools.
It intended to make significant progress on this issue this Parliament, he said.
Response list: ['Schools are to be required to teach sex and relationship education (SRE) as a statutory subject, a committee has said.']
Ground truth: Four key Commons committees are asking the education secretary to make Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education compulsory in schools.

Input: The comedian and actor had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Reports said he was 52.
Colleagues and peers used Twitter to praise the St Kitts-born Londoner, with comedian David Baddiel mourning a "real loss to comedy".
He came to prominence in the flagship black comedy The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company.
Fellow comedian Sean Hughes wrote on Twitter: "So so sad to hear about the truly wonderful Felix Dexter passing away.
"I hope you can feel the love in the comedy community fella. Rip."
Bill Bailey wrote: "Very sad news about my old friend Felix Dexter. A brilliant comedian, a superb comic actor, a lovely man I feel privileged to have known."
Once named Time Out comedian of the year, Dexter also featured in iconic BBC comedies The Fast Show and Absolutely Fabulous.
More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan.
His close friend, BBC Radio London presenter Eddie Nestor - who acted alongside Dexter for three years in The Real McCoy - told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It's a sad day. It's a really sad day. I went to see him and we talked and we laughed, and we laughed really hard.
"This is somebody who's been diagnosed with a terminal illness and you find yourself laughing really hard, belly laughs."
He added: "We've lost a talented, intelligent, articulate performer who could touch - who could reach out."
The Fast Show's Paul Whitehouse acted with Dexter in Bellamy's People.
Whitehouse told BBC Radio 5 live he was privileged to be close to the comedian and actor.
"He was a very modest, a very private man," he said.
"It was an honour to be close to him.
"He stuck in people's minds, Felix. There's been such an outpouring of warmth and affection for him."
Before entering comedy, Dexter studied law - something he said helped him deal with hecklers.
He named Billy Connolly and the late American comics Richard Pryor and Bill Hicks among his influences, and remained on the stand-up circuit throughout his career.
Later he featured in long-running staples Have I Got News For You and Grumpy Old Men, as well as the influential Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge.
As an actor, he had parts in Casualty and The Bill and appeared in the West End alongside Christian Slater.

Input: A local official said many of those who died had been in the market in Bodo. At least three suicide bombers were said to be involved.
The Nigeria-based militant group Boko Haram is suspected of carrying out the attack.
Last month, two female suicide bombers blew themselves up in Bodo.
Cameroon is part of a regional coalition fighting Boko Haram, along with Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Benin.
Although the militants have been driven from most of the areas they controlled in north-eastern Nigeria, they have continued to carry out suicide bombings and raids into neighbouring countries.
One witness in Bodo told the BBC that at least two of the attackers were teenage girls who had hidden their explosives in sacks of grain.
Another witness said two blasts had hit the market and another had targeted a roadblock.
"We were in the market [at] around 10 in the morning when we heard a blast. The second one went off not more than two minutes after and we took to our heels," the witness said.
"There is a vigilante roadblock just outside town where another bomb went off and killed six people."

Input: First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness asked the Northern Ireland Assembly speaker to "convene a special sitting".
The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was set up to encourage people to use green fuels to produce heat.
But serious flaws meant the scheme went far beyond its budget.
It paid out subsidies that were greater than the cost of the fuels used in the heating systems, allowing claimants could earn more cash the more fuel they burned.
In a joint statement, Mrs Foster and Mr McGuinness said they wanted MLAs to return to Stormont.
"This will facilitate a full statement to be made by the first minister to members on the matters of public concern relating to RHI," they added.
"RHI was discussed by the executive today and ministers around the table underlined the seriousness of the issues involved and the importance of restoring public confidence."
The ministers reiterated that "detailed plans are being finalised to significantly reduce the projected losses" to the Northern Ireland budget over the next 20 years.
Mrs Foster has faced calls for her to resign over her role in the scheme.
It was set up in 2012 when she was Stormont's enterprise minister, and she was later told about serious flaws in the initiative by a whistleblower, although the concerns were ignored by Deti officials.
Mrs Foster said civil servants did not inform her of any issues arising from the whistleblower's alert.
Earlier on Wednesday, BBC Radio Ulster's The Stephen Nolan Show revealed that she personally fought a decision by another minister to close the scheme.
A senior source she had a "heated conversation" with her DUP colleague Jonathan Bell, the then enterprise minister, over his plan to end the initiative in January.
The scheme then remained open to applications for two weeks.
The DUP said Mr Bell had extended the scheme "following representations, including those from other political parties".
Response list: ["Northern Ireland's ministers have called for a full statement to be made by the first minister on the issues surrounding the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme."]

Instruction: In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity. The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer.
Input: Passage: By 1875 Ricketts had named the tallest waterfall on Kitchen Creek Ganoga Falls, and in 1881, he renamed Long Pond as Ganoga Lake. Pennsylvania senator Charles R. Buckalew suggested the name Ganoga, an Iroquoian word which he said meant "water on the mountain" in the Seneca language. Donehoo's A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in  Pennsylvania identifies it as a Cayuga language word meaning "place of floating oil" and the name of a Cayuga village in New York. Whatever the meaning, Ganoga Lake is the source of the branch of Kitchen Creek that flows through Ganoga Glen, which has the tallest waterfall.A dam was built upstream of the waterfalls on the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek in 1842. Ricketts strengthened the dam circa 1905 as part of a hydroelectric power generation scheme, and renamed the body of water Lake Rose (Rose is a Ricketts family name). However, both the Lake Rose and Lake Leigh dams were "poorly constructed" and could not be used to generate power; both dams were condemned by the state and Lake Rose was drained in 1969. Ganoga Glen is not as steep as Glen Leigh; both glens are almost entirely in the Huntley Mountain Formation, with a small region at the southern end, including Waters Meet, in the Catskill Formation.
 
Ganoga Glen has ten named waterfalls in 1.1 miles (1.8 km). It is 1.8 miles (2.9 km) from PA 118 in the south to Waters Meet and the southern end of Ganoga Glen. From the north, it is 0.3 miles (0.48 km) from the Lake Rose trailhead parking lot by Lake Jean to Mohawk, the northernmost waterfall. There is also the 2.8-mile (4.5 km) Ganoga View Trail, which leads from Pennsylvania Route 487 in the west to Ganoga Falls. The Highland Trail, which meets the Falls Trail a short distance north of Mohawk Falls, is the 1.2-mile (1.9 km) connector between the northern ends of Ganoga Glen and Glen Leigh.Jeff Mitchell writes in Hiking the Endless Mountains: Exploring the Wilderness of Northeast Pennsylvania that Ganoga Glen has his "favorite place" in the park: "Here the trail wraps around ledges and underneath overhanging rocks, right next to the waterfalls. The roar of the falls reverberates against their rocky confines. The state park trail map says that Seneca, Delaware, and Mohican Falls are here, but it is hard to discern which falls are which because they explode from everywhere and are continuous.". 
Question: What is the name of the person that Charles R. Buckalew suggested the names to?
Response list: ['Ricketts.']
Ground truth: Ricketts.

Input: Passage: When high school music teacher Michael McCann discovers his wife is pregnant by his best friend, he divorces her and retreats into a life of solitude as a maker of finely crafted furniture in rural Virginia. Five years later, his only companion is a valuable collection of gold coins. Tanny Newland, the unsavory younger brother of politician John Newland, crashes his brother's car in the woods surrounding Michael's house, seriously injuring the woman he is with. Afraid of being arrested for drunk driving, Tanny steals Michael's coins while he is sleeping, takes off into the night and is never seen again.
Weeks later during a winter storm, Michael is startled to discover a toddler has wandered into his home while he was outside gathering wood. A short distance away he discovers the body of her mother, a heroin addict whose car had run out of gas nearby. Unbeknownst to him, the child is the illegitimate daughter of John Newland, who participates in the investigation but keeps his relationship to the child a secret in order to protect his career.
Michael is permitted to adopt the child and christens her Mathilda. She proves to be a bit of a handful in her early years, but with the help of friend and local shopkeeper April Simon, Michael manages to raise her to be a bright, personable, precocious young lady, and the once sour, lonely man is transformed by her presence. As John Newland watches his daughter grow older, he begins to invite her to join him and wife Nancy in their home. John arranges for her to learn to ride a horse, eventually giving her one of her own.
Due to Nancy's two miscarriages and the couple's deep desire to have a child, Nancy insists on adoption. John finally reveals Mathilda's true identity and his desire to adopt her properly. Nancy encourages him to gain custody of the girl, and a trial ensues. 
Question: What is the full name of the person whose car is crashed in the woods by their sibling?
Response list: ['John Newland.']
Ground truth: John Newland.

Input: Passage: Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd "a spent force creatively." When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. He later told The Sunday Times: "Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him." In 2013, Waters said he had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members, and was wrong to have attempted to stop the others using it. 
Question: What is the last name of the person whose affairs were managed by Peter Rudge?
Response list: ['Waters.']
Ground truth: Waters.

Input: Passage: In the year 2000, Dick Harper has been promoted to Vice President of Communications for a large media corporation known as Globodyne. The following day, he is on a television program with presidential candidate Ralph Nader, who calls Globodyne "perverters of the American dream", claiming it helps the super-rich get even wealthier. As they speak, Globodyne's stock value collapses, rendering all investments – including all the employees' savings and pensions – worthless. Dick arrives home, where his wife Jane tells him that she quit her job as a travel agent following his promotion to spend more time with the family. Dick breaks the news of the company's failure over dinner. Despite his attempts, Dick is unable to find another job with comparable pay, and within a short time, the family faces bankruptcy.
After accepting the prospect of being poor, Dick and Jane apply for low-paying jobs. Both are unable to keep them, and soon their utilities are cut off, forcing them to sell off personal property to stay afloat. When they are confronted with a 24-hour eviction notice, Dick decides to turn to a life of crime. After several failed robbery attempts, Dick and Jane successfully rob a head shop. They begin nightly robbing sprees and become more comfortable and professional over time. They soon steal enough money to pay off their debts including their house and car, both of which were about to be repossessed. For one last heist, Dick and Jane plan to rob a local bank. All goes as planned until the Petersons – another couple formerly employed at Globodyne – make an amateurish attempt to rob the same bank. The Petersons are quickly arrested, and the Harpers take advantage of the hysteria to evade police and escape. 
Question: What was Dick's company called that caused a stock dive?
Response list: ['Globodyne.']
Ground truth: "perverters of the American dream".

Input: Passage: Ben and Arthur are a gay couple eagerly awaiting the legalization of gay marriage in Hawaii so that they may travel there for their dream wedding. After a news bulletin that a judge has made a ruling that will allow gay marriages to take place, the men purchase plane tickets and prepare to depart; however, before they leave, they discover that a challenge to the judge's ruling has resulted in a suspension of gay marriage in Hawaii, pending further judicial review. Ben takes advantage of the delay to inform Arthur that he is actually already married to a woman named Tammy, whom he wed out of societal pressure before he came to terms with his homosexuality and from whom he has been separated since before he and Arthur met. Arthur becomes angry, but decides to stay with Ben anyway. Shortly thereafter, Ben contacts Tammy, finally comes out to her, and asks her for a divorce.
After the disappointment of their near-wedding, Ben and Arthur resume their daily life, working in a small diner in Los Angeles, where Ben is a dishwasher and Arthur is a waiter. Although Ben—a former nurse who quit to pursue a music career—enjoys the manual labor and hours, Arthur has grown impatient with servitude and putting up with needy customers. One night, Arthur decides to quit and go back to college, so that he can earn an MBA and open up his own sex shop. Although the loss of income to the household means that Ben will have to quit and return to being a nurse, he agrees to do so in order to help Arthur pursue his dream. 
Question: What are the gay couple prohibited from having in Hawaii?
Response list: ['gay marriage.']
Ground truth: their dream wedding.

Input: Passage: In 1933, Freya Roth is a young German girl engaged to a Nazi party member. When she realizes the true nature of his political views she breaks the engagement and turns her attention to anti-Nazi Martin Breitner. Her father, Professor Roth, does not abide by the attitude of the new order towards scientific fact.
Though his stepsons Erich and Otto eagerly embrace the regime, Professor Roth's reluctance to conform leads at first to a boycott of his classes and eventually to his arrest and a sentence of forced physical labor. His wife is permitted a five-minute visit in which the professor urges her to take Freya and her younger brother and leave the country. He dies soon after.
Freya is kept from leaving by Nazi officials suspicious of her father's work. She reunites with Martin and together they attempt to escape through a mountain pass. A squad reluctantly led by her former fiancee gives chase and Freya is fatally wounded, dying in Martin's arms just after they cross the border. Later, Erich and Otto are informed of their sister's death. Erich responds with anger towards Martin.  Otto, however, experiences an epiphany, and flees their once-happy home, rejecting the Nazis and their cruel doctrine. 
Question: What is the first name of the person whose father the Nazi officials are suspicious of?
Response list: ['Freya.']
Ground truth: Freya.

Input: Passage: By the time Smetana completed his schooling, his father's fortunes had declined. Although František now agreed that his son should follow a musical career, he could not provide financial support. In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty gulden, and no immediate prospects. Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kateřina Kolářová's mother to Josef Proksch, head of the Prague Music Institute—where Kateřina was now studying. Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on Beethoven, Chopin, Berlioz and the Leipzig circle of Liszt. In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, and at the same time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.For the next three years, besides teaching piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, bagatelles, impromptus and the G minor Piano Sonata. In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French composer at a reception arranged by Proksch. At the home of Count Thun he met Robert and Clara Schumann, and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work—they detected too much of Berlioz in it. Meanwhile, his friendship with Kateřina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement. He then set out on a tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a concert pianist. 
Question: What is the name of the person who showed Robert and Clara Schumann their G minor sonata?
Response list: ['Smetana.']
Ground truth: Smetana.

Input: Passage: Wildlife photographer Pickett Smith is taking photographs of the local flora and fauna as he canoes through a swamp surrounding an island containing the affluent mansion estate of the wealthy and influential Crockett family. Also evident throughout the swamp are numerous indicators of pollution, which Pickett believes are connected to pesticide use on the island plantation. After Clint Crockett accidentally tips over Smith's canoe, he and his sister Karen escort Smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire Crockett family. The grouchy, wheelchair-bound patriarch Jason intends on spending the next day enjoying both the 4th of July and his own birthday celebrations uninterrupted. Due to the mutual dislike of the fauna around the mansion, Jason sends a man named Grover to spray pesticide in order to get rid of the frogs. Pickett later discovers Grover's corpse covered in snakebites in the swamp not far from the house. Despite this warning, Jason continues with his celebrations the next day.
Early next morning, Michael Martindale sets out to check on a possible downed telephone line. He accidentally shoots himself in the leg and is rendered immobile by strange white moss hanging down from the surrounding trees. Tarantulas descend from the branches and kill him. 
Back on the estate, Jason's sister, Iris Martindale sends her son, Kenneth into the greenhouse to collect flowers for a centerpiece. As he gathers the flowers, he fails to notice dozens of tokay geckos entering behind him. The geckos swarm over the stacked shelves, knocking over numerous jars of poisonous chemicals, and the resulting toxic gas asphyxiates him.
Seeing the danger posed by the animals, Pickett suggests that everyone should leave the island, but Jason is adamant that nothing will ruin his birthday. 
Question: How did Iris's son die?
Response list: ['toxic gas.']
Ground truth: toxic gas asphyxiates him.

Input: Passage: Eakins referred to the painting as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, "apparently lost in a contemplative moment". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast.
The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.In Eakins' oeuvre, The Swimming Hole was immediately preceded by a number of similar works on the Arcadian theme. These correspond to lectures he gave on Ancient Greek sculpture and were inspired by the Pennsylvania Academy's casts of Phidias' Pan-Athenaic procession from the Parthenon marbles. A series of photographs, relief sculptures, and oil sketches culminated in the 1883 Arcadia, a painting that also featured nude figures—posed for by a student, a nephew, and the artist's fiancée—in a pastoral landscape. 
Question: What are the four titles the painting has been referred as?
Response list: ['Swimming.']
Ground truth: Swimming.

Input: Passage: In 1948, Frank Wheeler meets April at a party. He is a longshoreman, hoping to be a cashier; she wants to be an actress. Frank later secures a sales position with Knox Machines, for which his father worked for 20 years, and he and April marry. The Wheelers move to 115 Revolutionary Road in suburban Connecticut when April becomes pregnant.
The couple becomes close friends with their realtor Helen Givings and her husband Howard Givings, and neighbor Milly Campbell and her husband Shep. To their friends, the Wheelers are the perfect couple, but their relationship is troubled. April fails to make a career out of acting, while Frank hates the tedium of his work. On his 30th birthday, Frank invites a secretary at work to have a drink with him at a bar.  She accepts, gets tipsy, and they end up having sex in a hotel. Meanwhile, Helen has asked April if they will meet her son, John, who had been in an insane asylum.  She thinks the younger couple may be able to help her son with his condition. April accepts.
April wants new scenery and a chance to support the family so Frank can find his passion, so she suggests that they move to Paris to start a new life away from the "hopeless emptiness" of their repetitive lifestyle. Frank balks at the idea at first, but becomes convinced. Over the next several weeks, the Wheelers tell their various friends about their plans to live in Paris, but surprisingly, the only person who seems to comprehend their decision is John.
As the couple prepares to move, they are forced to reconsider. Frank is offered a promotion, and April becomes pregnant again. When Frank discovers she is contemplating having an abortion, he is furious and starts screaming at April, leading to a serious altercation, in which April says that they had their second child only to prove the first child was not a "mistake".

Freya is kept from leaving by Nazi officials suspicious of her father's work. She reunites with Martin and together they attempt to escape through a mountain pass. A squad reluctantly led by her former fiancee gives chase and Freya is fatally wounded, dying in Martin's arms just after they cross the border. Later, Erich and Otto are informed of their sister's death. Erich responds with anger towards Martin.  Otto, however, experiences an epiphany, and flees their once-happy home, rejecting the Nazis and their cruel doctrine. 
Question: What is the full name of the person who reunites with Martin?
Response list: ['Freya Roth.']
Ground truth: Freya Roth.

Input: Passage: Temperley writes: "After 1855 [Bennett] was spurred by belated honours, and occasional commissions, to compose a respectable number of significant and substantial works, though it was too late to recapture his early self-confidence." Works from his later years included the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti; a pastoral cantata, The May Queen, Op. 39, for the opening of the Leeds Town Hall in 1858; an Ode (Op. 40) with words by Alfred, Lord Tennyson for the opening of the 1862 International Exhibition in London; an Installation Ode for Cambridge University (Op. 41) with words by Charles Kingsley, which included a lament for the late Prince Albert; a symphony in G minor (Op. 43); a sacred cantata,The Woman of Samaria for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1867; and finally a second Piano Sonata (The Maid of Orleans, Op. 46). Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa, who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct anything by Bennett. Eventually it was conducted by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber also commissioned for the occasion. The affair leaked into the press, and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour.In March 1856 Bennett, while still teaching at the RAM and Queen's College, was elected Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge. He modernised the system of awarding music degrees, instituting viva voce examinations and requiring candidates for doctorates to first take the degree of Bachelor of Music. Two years later on 8 June 1868 the newly formed (later Royal) College of Organists awarded him an Honorary Fellowship.In 1858 came yet another clash involving Costa, when the autocratic Earl of Westmorland, the original founder of the RAM, saw fit to arrange a subscription concert for the Academy to include a Mass of his own composition, to be conducted by Costa and using the orchestra and singers of the Opera, over the heads of the Academy directors. Bennett resigned from the RAM at this overbearing behaviour, and was not to return until 1866. Towards the end of 1862 Bennett's wife died after a painful illness. His biographer W. B. Squire suggests that "he never recovered from the effects of Mrs. Bennett's death, and that henceforward a painful change in him became apparent to his friends." In 1865 Bennett again visited Leipzig where he was reunited with old friends including Ferdinand David, and his Op. 43 Symphony was performed.

Input: Passage: During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky.
On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading "NKVD" on the memorial, covering the word "Nazis" in the inscription such that it read "In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941." Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented:
It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.
Brzezinski further stated:
The fact that the Soviet government has enabled me to be here—and the Soviets know my views—is symbolic of the breach with Stalinism that perestroika represents.
His remarks were given extensive coverage on Soviet television. At the ceremony he placed a bouquet of red roses bearing a handwritten message penned in both Polish and English: "For the victims of Stalin and the NKVD. Zbigniew Brzezinski".On 13 April 1990, the forty-seventh anniversary of the discovery of the mass graves, the USSR formally expressed "profound regret" and admitted Soviet secret police responsibility. The day was declared a worldwide Katyn Memorial Day (Polish: Światowy Dzień Pamięci Ofiar Katynia).

Input: Passage: Bartlett decided to send a team back to establish the exact location of the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3 km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and his group (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) announced they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: "We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land." The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp. Thereafter the only hint of their fate was a sailor's scarf belonging to Morris, later found buried in an ice floe. It was assumed that the four had either been crushed by the ice, or had fallen through it.

Input: Passage: Lyon Gaultier is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved.
Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him. Figuring that this would be the best way to earn the money he needs to get to L.A., Lyon fights in a no-holds-barred bare-knuckle fights to finance the trip.
Once in L.A. Lyon goes to the hospital where his brother was taken. He learns that he cannot avenge his brother's murder, as he failed to identify his killers before dying. Grief-stricken, Lyon asks the help of Joshua who tracks down his brother's widow's address. However she refuses to accept any financial aid from him, even though she obviously needs it, because she is angry with Lyon for "deserting" his brother years ago. She threatens to call the cops and Lyon has no choice but to leave.

Input: Passage: Although no new fighting techniques were introduced during the Texas Revolution, casualty figures were quite unusual for the time.  Generally in 19th-century warfare, the number of wounded outnumbered those killed by a factor of two or three.  From October 1835 through April 1836, approximately 1,000 Mexican and 700 Texian soldiers died, while the wounded numbered 500 Mexican and 100 Texian.  The deviation from the norm was due to Santa Anna's decision to label Texian rebels as traitors and to the Texian desire for revenge.During the revolution, Texian soldiers gained a reputation for courage and militance.   Lack points out that fewer than five percent of the Texian population enrolled in the army during the war, a fairly low rate of participation.  Texian soldiers recognized that the Mexican cavalry was far superior to their own.  Over the next decade, the Texas Rangers borrowed Mexican cavalry tactics and adopted the Spanish saddle and spurs, the riata, and the bandana.The Texas Veterans Association, composed solely of revolutionary veterans living in Texas, was active from 1873 through 1901 and played a key role in convincing the legislature to create a monument to honor the San Jacinto veterans.  In the late 19th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the San Jacinto battlesite, which is now home to the San Jacinto Monument, the tallest stone column monument in the world.  In the early 20th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the Alamo Mission, now an official state shrine. In front of the church, in the center of Alamo Plaza, stands a cenotaph designed by Pompeo Coppini which commemorates the defenders who died during the battle. More than 2.5 million people visit the Alamo every year.The Texas Revolution has been the subject of poetry and of many books, plays and films. Most English-language treatments reflect the perspectives of the Anglos and are centered primarily on the battle of the Alamo.  From the first novel depicting events of the revolution, 1838's Mexico versus Texas, through the mid-20th century, most works contained  themes of anticlericalism and racism, depicting the battle as a fight for freedom between good (Anglo Texian) and evil (Mexican). In both English- and Spanish-language literature, the Alamo is often compared to the battle of Thermopylae.  The 1950s Disney miniseries Davy Crockett, which was largely based on myth, created a worldwide craze for everything Alamo-related. Within several years, John Wayne directed and starred in one of the best-known and perhaps least historically accurate film versions, The Alamo (1960).  Notably, this version made the first attempt to leave behind racial stereotypes; it was still banned in Mexico.  In the late 1970s, works about the Alamo began to explore Tejano perspectives, which had been all but extinguished even from textbooks about the revolution, and to explore the revolution's links to slavery.

Input: Passage: In 1985, Tim Gane formed McCarthy, a band from Essex, England, known for their left-wing politics. Gane met Lætitia Sadier, born in France, at a McCarthy concert in Paris and the two quickly fell in love. The musically-inclined Sadier was disillusioned with the rock scene in France and soon moved to London to be with Gane and pursue her career. In 1990, after three albums, McCarthy broke up and Gane immediately formed Stereolab with Sadier (who had also contributed vocals to McCarthy's final album), ex-Chills bassist Martin Kean and Gina Morris on backing vocals. Stereolab's name was taken from a division of Vanguard Records demonstrating hi-fi effects.
Gane and Sadier, along with future band manager Martin Pike, created a record label called Duophonic Super 45s which, along with later offshoot Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, would become commonly known as "Duophonic". Gane said that their "original plan" was to distribute multiple 7 and 10 inch records "–to just do one a month and keep doing them in small editions". The 10 inch vinyl EP Super 45, released in May 1991, was the first release for both Stereolab and the label, and was sold through mail order and through the Rough Trade Shop in London. Super 45's band-designed album art and packaging was the first of many customised and limited-edition Duophonic records. In a 1996 interview in The Wire, Gane calls the "do-it-yourself" aesthetic behind Duophonic "empowering", and said that by releasing one's own music "you learn; it creates more music, more ideas".Stereolab released the EP, Super-Electric in September 1991, and a single, titled Stunning Debut Album, followed in November 1991 (which was neither debut nor album). The early material was rock and guitar-oriented; of Super-Electric, Jason Ankeny wrote in AllMusic that "Droning guitars, skeletal rhythms, and pop hooks—not vintage synths and pointillist melodies—were their calling cards ..." Under the independent label Too Pure, the group's first full-length album, Peng! was released in May 1992. A compilation titled, Switched On, was released in October 1992 and would be part of a series of compilations that anthologise the band's more obscure material.Around this time, the line-up consisted of Gane and Sadier plus vocalist and guitarist Mary Hansen, drummer Andy Ramsay, bassist Duncan Brown, and keyboardist Katharine Gifford. Hansen, born in Australia, had been in touch with Gane since his McCarthy days. After joining, she and Sadier developed a style of vocal counterpoint that distinguished Stereolab's sound. After a concert in the early 1990s, the band was introduced to Sean O'Hagan, who had recently formed the band the High Llamas. He recalled: "we got on very well. Their keyboard player left and they needed a quick replacement for a tour. I filled in but then was invited in on [their next] record. I was allowed to make suggestions and the fun started.".

Input: Passage: San Francisco (SF; , Spanish: [sam fɾanˈsisko]; Spanish for 'Saint Francis'), officially the City and County of San Francisco, is a city in, and the cultural, commercial, and financial center of, Northern California. San Francisco is the 13th-most populous city in the United States, and the fourth-most populous in California, with 883,305 residents as of 2018. It covers an area of about 46.89 square miles (121.4 km2), mostly at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area, making it the second-most densely populated large US city, and the fifth-most densely populated U.S. county, behind only four of the five New York City boroughs. San Francisco is also part of the fifth-most populous primary statistical area in the United States, the San Jose–San Francisco–Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area (9.67 million residents).
As of 2017, it was the seventh-highest income county in the United States, with a per capita personal income of $119,868. As of 2015, San Francisco proper had a GDP of $154.2 billion, and a GDP per capita of $177,968. The San Francisco CSA was the country's third-largest urban economy as of 2017, with a GDP of $907 billion.  Of the 500+ primary statistical areas in the US, the San Francisco CSA had among the highest GDP per capita in 2017, at $93,938. San Francisco was ranked 14th in the world and third in the United States on the Global Financial Centres Index as of September 2018.San Francisco was founded on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain established Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de Asís a few miles away, all named for St. Francis of Assisi. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856. San Francisco's status as the West Coast's largest city peaked between 1870 and 1900, when around 25% of California's population resided in the city proper.  After three-quarters of the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire, San Francisco was quickly rebuilt, hosting the Panama-Pacific International Exposition nine years later. In World War II, San Francisco was a major port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater. It then became the birthplace of the United Nations in 1945. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, significant immigration, liberalizing attitudes, along with the rise of the "hippie" counterculture, the Sexual Revolution, the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States. Politically, the city votes strongly along liberal Democratic Party lines.

Input: Passage: Little documentary evidence of the games remains; contemporary and near-contemporary writings mostly record the major details and concentrate on the opening days. The poet Martial gives the most complete and only truly contemporary account in the form of his De Spectaculis ("On the Spectacles"), a somewhat sycophantic series of epigrams detailing the individual events of the games as an illustration of Titus' power and benevolence. Much of the work is concerned with praising Titus, and there have been difficulties with authenticating, dating and translating various portions, but Martial does give details of events not covered by other sources and the only known surviving complete record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena.The historian Suetonius was born in about AD 70, and started writing around AD 100. He was a child at the time of the games, but it is possible that he was born and raised in Rome, so he may have witnessed the inaugural games first-hand. His De Vita Caesarum (Lives of the Caesars, known also as The Twelve Caesars or Lives of the Twelve Caesars) probably completed around AD 117 to 127, includes some detail on the opening days of the games. Later in his history of Titus he reveals further information about the games. Suetonius' histories of the early Caesars have been criticised for being based on rumour and gossip rather than accurate historical sources, and he often reports from sources which contradict each other without attempting to analyse their quality or accuracy. However, he is generally regarded as a thorough scholar and has been praised for his balanced treatment of his subjects.The only other major source of information on the games is Cassius Dio who lived in the latter second and early third centuries. His History of Rome spans 80 books written in 22 years, but much of which are only fragments. He is noted for his attention to detail in administrative affairs, but for major events his writing can be merely impressionistic, with a greater emphasis put on his interpretation of the events' significance within the wider historical context rather than reporting details. His sources are varied: he relies on many of the major commentators but also seems to have paid close attention to public records. His account of the Titus games is not sourced. 
Question: What is the full name of the person whose writing can be merely impressionistic for major events?
Response list: ['Cassius Dio.']

The group loses the use of their rehearsal space, forcing them to try to raise money or practice in other locations. Eventually they secure a space in a ballet school, on the condition that they include five ballet dancers in their routine. At first, they struggle to get along, but they all become friends in the end.
One of the teachers at the ballet school, Helena, takes Carly to a ballet where she starts getting ideas for their routine.

Input: Passage: In support of Nine Inch Nails' third full-length studio album, The Fragile, the live-band reformed for the Fragility tour.  The lineup remained largely the same from the Self-Destruct tour, featuring Finck, Clouser, and Lohner.  To replace long-time member Vrenna, Reznor held open auditions to find a new drummer, eventually picking then-unknown Jerome Dillon.  Dillon would remain a member of the live band until 2005.
Nine Inch Nails' record label at the time, Interscope Records, reportedly refused to fund the promotional tour following The Fragile's lukewarm sales.  Reznor instead committed himself to fund the entire tour out of his own pocket, concluding that "The reality is, I’m broke at the end of the tour," but also adding "I will never present a show that isn’t fantastic."The Fragility tour began in late 1999, running until mid-2000, and was broken into two major legs, Fragility 1.0 and Fragility 2.0 respectively.  Destinations included Europe, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and North America.  Before the first Fragility performance date in Spain, Nine Inch Nails opened their final rehearsal in London to 100 fans. Kick-starting the tour was a performance of the title track from The Fragile at the MTV Video Music Awards.  Atari Teenage Riot opened for Nine Inch Nails during Fragility 1.0, and A Perfect Circle for Fragility 2.0.  At the time, A Perfect Circle featured Josh Freese on drums, who would later replace Dillon and play drums for Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007. The tour featured increasingly large production values, including a triptych video display created by contemporary video artist Bill Viola. Rolling Stone magazine named Fragility the best tour of 2000.In 2002, the tour documentary And All That Could Have Been was released featuring a collection of performances from the Fragility 2.0 tour.  While making the DVD, Reznor commented on the tour in retrospect by saying "I thought the show was really, really good when we were doing it", but later admitted that he "can't watch [the DVD] at all. I was sick for most of that tour and I really don't think it was Nine Inch Nails at its best".

Input: Passage: The Wiggles are an Australian children's music group formed in Sydney, New South Wales, in 1991. Since 2013, the group members are Anthony Field, Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce, and Emma Watkins.  The original members were Field, Phillip Wilcher, Murray Cook, Greg Page, and Jeff Fatt. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Page, Cook, and Fatt retired, and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce, and Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects.
Field and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band The Cockroaches in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at Macquarie University, where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of children's music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album, and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time.  The group augmented their act with animal characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog, as well as the character Captain Feathersword, played by Paul Paddick since 1993.  They travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The group's DVDs, CDs, and television programs have been produced independently since their inception.  Their high point came in the early 2000s, after they broke into the American market.
The group was formally consolidated in 2005.  They were listed at the top of Business Review Weekly's top-earning Australian entertainers four years in a row, and earned A$45 million in 2009.  In 2011, the worldwide recession hit The Wiggles, as it had done for many Australian entertainers; they earned $28 million, but they still appeared second on BRW's list that year.  The Wiggles have enjoyed almost universal approval throughout their history, and their music has been played in pre-schools all over the world.  They have earned several Platinum, Double Platinum and Multi-Platinum records, as well as sold 23 million DVDs and 7 million CDs, and have performed, on average, to one million people per year.  The group has also earned multiple Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) and Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Music Awards.

Input: Passage: The Five was among the myriad of subjects Tchaikovsky discussed with his benefactress, Nadezhda von Meck. By January 1878, when he wrote to Mrs. von Meck about its members, he had drifted far from their musical world and ideals. In addition, The Five's finest days had long passed. Despite considerable effort in writing operas and songs, Cui had become better known as a critic than as a composer, and even his critical efforts competed for time with his career as an army engineer and expert in the science of fortification. Balakirev had withdrawn completely from the musical scene, Mussorgsky was sinking ever deeper into alcoholism, and Borodin's creative activities increasingly took a back seat to his official duties as a professor of chemistry.
Only Rimsky-Korsakov actively pursued a full-time musical career, and he was under increasing fire from his fellow nationalists for much the same reason as Tchaikovsky had been. Like Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov had found that, for his own artistic growth to continue unabated, he had to study and master Western classical forms and techniques. Borodin called it "apostasy", adding, "Many are grieved at present by the fact that Korsakov has turned back, has thrown himself into a study of musical antiquity. I do not bemoan it. It is understandable...." Mussorgsky was harsher: "[T]he mighty kuchka had degenerated into soulless traitors."Tchaikovsky's analysis of each of The Five was unsparing. While at least some of his observations may seem distorted and prejudiced, he also mentions some details which ring clear and true. His diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is very accurate. He also calls Mussorgsky the most gifted musically of the Five, though Tchaikovsky could not appreciate the forms Mussorgsky's originality took. Nonetheless, he badly underestimates Borodin's technique and gives Balakirev far less than his full due—all the more telling in light of Balakirev's help in conceiving and shaping Romeo and Juliet.Tchaikovsky wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that all of the kuchka were talented but also "infected to the core" with conceit and "a purely dilettantish confidence in their superiority." He went into some detail about Rimsky-Korsakov's epiphany and turnaround regarding musical training, and his efforts to remedy this situation for himself. Tchaikovsky then called Cui "a talented dilettante" whose music "has no originality, but is clever and graceful"; Borodin a man who "has talent, even a strong one, but it has perished through neglect ... and his technique is so weak that he cannot write a single line [of music] without outside help"; Mussorgsky "a hopeless case", superior in talent but "narrow-minded, devoid of any urge towards self-perfection"; and Balakirev as one with "enormous talent" yet who had also "done much harm" as "the general inventor of all the theories of this strange group". 
Question: What is the name of the person whose diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is very accurate?

Input: Passage: In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—"Night After Night", and "I Had a Dream About You, Baby", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's "The Usual". The film was a critical and commercial flop.
Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, "Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual."The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: "The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant." The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Michael Gray wrote that the album was: "Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s." The track "Most of the Time", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while "What Was It You Wanted?" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans. The religious imagery of "Ring Them Bells" struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith. 
Question: What were the full names of the four Traveling Wilburys that recorded a second album?
Response list: ['George Harrison.']

Input: Passage: Rolling Stone named "Single Ladies" the best song of 2008, and wrote, "The beat ... is irresistible and exuberant, the vocal hook is stormy and virtuosic." "Single Ladies" ranked as the second-best song of the 2000s decade in the magazine's 2009 readers' poll, and Rolling Stone critics placed it at number 50 on the list of the 100 Best Songs of the Decade. "Single Ladies" was placed at number two on MTV News' list of The Best Songs of 2008; James Montgomery called it "hyperactive and supercharged in ways I never thought possible. It's epic and sexy and even a bit sad." "There is absolutely zero chance Beyoncé ever releases a single like this ever again", Montgomery concluded. Time magazine's critic Josh Tyrangiel, who called the song "ludicrously infectious", ranked it as the seventh-best song of 2008. Douglas Wolf of the same publication placed it at number nine on his list of the All-Time 100 Songs."Single Ladies" appeared at number six on the Eye Weekly's critics' list of the Best Singles of 2008, and at number six on About.com's Mark Edward Nero's list of the Best R&B Songs of 2008. On The Village Voice's year-end Pazz & Jop singles list, "Single Ladies" was ranked at numbers three and forty one in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Additionally, the Maurice Joshua Club Mix of the song was ranked at number 443 on the 2008 list. "Single Ladies" was named the best song of the 2000s decade by Black Entertainment Television (BET). Sarah Rodman, writing for The Boston Globe, named "Single Ladies" the fourth most irresistible song of the decade, and stated, "[Beyoncé] combined leotards with crass engagement-bling baiting into one delicious sexy-yet-antiquated package. The video had the whole world dancing and waving along via YouTube." VH1 ranked "Single Ladies" at number sixteen on its list of The 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s. In his book Eating the Dinosaur (2009), Chuck Klosterman wrote that "Single Ladies" is "arguably the first song overtly marketed toward urban bachelorette parties". Jody Rosen of The New Yorker credited the melodies that float and dart over the thump for creating a new sound in music that didn't exist in the world before Beyoncé. He further wrote, "If they sound 'normal' now, it's because Beyoncé, and her many followers, have retrained our ears.". 
Question: What publication listed the "ludicrously infectious" single as sixteenth on the 100 Greatest songs of the 2000s?

Input: Passage: McVeigh later said that he had contemplated assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.A resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because of the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The Murrah building had been previously targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell. The group had plotted to park "a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer." After Snell's appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied, he was executed the same day as the Murrah bombing.The nine-story building, built in 1977, was named for a federal judge and housed fourteen federal agencies, including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps. The Murrah building was chosen for its glass front – which was expected to shatter under the impact of the blast – and its adjacent large, open parking lot across the street, which might absorb and dissipate some of the force, and protect the occupants of nearby non-federal buildings. In addition, McVeigh believed that the open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes. The attack was planned to take place on April 19, 1995, to coincide with the 2nd anniversary of the Waco siege and the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord. 
Question: What is the full name of McVeigh's target, which he and Fortier visited to inspect in December 1994?

Input: Passage: The film opens with an English schoolteacher, Gwen Mayfield, packing up her belongings at a mission school in colonial Africa. The local witch doctors have led a rebellion, and they reach the school before she is able to escape—the shaman wearing a body mask. Gwen screams, and the scene dissolves to the opening credits.
The next scene is back home in England, where Gwen meets with the apparently Reverend Alan Bax for a job interview. We discover that Gwen suffered a nervous breakdown from whatever she experienced at the hand of the rebels when the school was attacked. Alan is impressed by Gwen and hires her to be the new head teacher at the small private school he and his sister, well-known journalist Stephanie Bax, run for the local children in the village of Heddaby.
Upon moving into the teacher's cottage, Gwen asks her maid, Valerie Creek, where she might find the rectory. Valerie is confused—she knows there is no rectory—until Gwen explains she would like to thank Mr. Bax. "Oh, you mean the Baxes' house!" she says, and shows her the way after tea.
At the house, Gwen meets Stephanie and mentions she tried to look for the church on the way but couldn't find it. Stephanie explains there isn't any church, and no "Reverend Alan Bax"—but that the pretence is completely harmless. Alan shows Gwen the old church, now a ruin, as he walks her home. He confesses to her that he is not really a priest—"I wanted to enter the Church, but I failed." He notes that he does not try to persuade anyone or officiate, but sometimes wears the priestly collar "for security." Gwen tries to find out more about why the old church was left a ruin but Alan mysteriously turns silent and seems to be unable to move, so she says good night and leaves him to his thoughts.

Input: Passage: Edward Dalyngrigge was a younger son and thus deprived of his father's estates through the practice of primogeniture, hence he had to make his own fortunes. By 1378, he owned the manor of Bodiam by marrying into a land-owning family. From 1379 to 1388, Dalyngrigge was a Knight of the Shire for Sussex and one of the most influential people in the county. By the time he applied to the king for a licence to crenellate (build a castle), the Hundred Years' War had been fought between England and France for nearly 50 years. Edward III of England (reigned 1327–1377) pressed his claim for the French throne and secured the territories of Aquitaine and Calais. Dalyngrigge was one of many Englishmen who travelled to France to seek their fortune as members of Free Companies – groups of mercenaries who fought for the highest bidder. He left for France in 1367 and journeyed with Lionel, Duke of Clarence and son of Edward III. After fighting under the Earl of Arundel, Dalyngrigge joined the company of Sir Robert Knolles, a notorious commander who was reputed to have made 100,000 gold crowns as a mercenary from pillage and plunder. It was as a member of the Free Companies that Dalyngrigge raised the money to build Bodiam Castle; he returned to England in 1377.The Treaty of Bruges (1375) ensured peace for two years, but after it expired, fighting resumed between England and France. In 1377 Edward III was succeeded by Richard II. During the war, England and France struggled for control of the English Channel, with raids on both coasts. With the renewed hostilities, Parliament voted that money should be spent on defending and fortifying England's south coast, and defences were erected in Kent in anticipation of a French invasion. There was internal unrest as well as external threats, and Dalyngrigge was involved in suppressing the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. The manor of Bodiam was granted a charter in 1383 permitting a weekly market and an annual fair to be held. In 1385, a fleet of 1,200 ships – variously cogs, barges, and galleys – gathered across the English Channel at Sluys, Flanders; the population of southern England was in a state of panic. Later in the year, Edward Dalyngrigge was granted a licence to fortify his manor house.

Input: Passage: Carl Schaffner is a crooked British (previously German) businessman who flees to Mexico after stealing company funds. While travelling by train, Schaffner decides to evade authorities. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff. Carl later discovers that Scarff is wanted in Mexico as a political assassin. Carl then tracks down Scarff, who is resting from his injuries, to get back his original passport. Carl arrives in Mexico and is captured by the local police, who mistake him for Scarff. Carl then fights to show his true identity to the local police.  The plan seems foolproof until he is forced to care for the dog of Scarff's dog. The local police chief and Scotland Yard inspector Hadden conspire to keep him trapped in the Mexican border town of Katrina in an effort to get him to cross the bridge back into the U.S. and face justice. The misanthropic Schaffner has grown attached to Scarff's pet spaniel and is tricked into going across the dividing line of the bridge to get the dog. He is accidentally killed trying to escape the authorities. The final irony is that the discovery of his own humanity has cost the cynical, friendless Schaffner his life.

Input: Passage: Of the main characters, only Otho is not morally contemptible. Agrippina is an unscrupulous schemer; Nero, while not yet the monster he would become, is pampered and hypocritical; Claudius is pompous, complacent, and something of a buffoon, while Poppaea, the first of Handel's sex kittens, is also a liar and a flirt. The freedmen Pallas and Narcissus are self-serving and salacious. All, however, have some redeeming features, and all have arias that express genuine emotion. The situations in which they find themselves are sometimes comic, but never farcical—like Mozart in the Da Ponte operas, Handel avoids laughing at his characters.In Agrippina the da capo aria is the musical form used to illustrate character in the context of the opera. The first four arias of the work exemplify this: Nero's "Con raggio", in a minor key and with a descending figure on the key phrase "il trono ascenderò" ("I will ascend the throne") characterises him as weak and irresolute. Pallas's first aria "La mia sorte fortunata", with its "wide-leaping melodic phrasing" introduces him as a bold, heroic figure, contrasting with his rival Narcissus whose introspective nature is displayed in his delicate aria "Volo pronto" which immediately follows. Agrippina's introductory aria "L'alma mia" has a mock-military form which reflects her outward power, while subtle musical phrasing establishes her real emotional state. Poppaea's arias are uniformly light and rhythmic, while Claudius's short love song "Vieni O cara" gives a glimpse of his inner feelings, and is considered one of the gems of the score.

Input: Passage: Switchboard operator Marie Lawson is conned by admirer Nicky, who tells her it is just a practical joke, into redirecting a phone call. However, Nicky uses what he learns to his own benefit, costing the intended recipient a lot of money. When the victim complains to Marie's boss, telephone repairmen Terry Riley and John are called in to see if the phone was tapped. When it is found not to be, Marie loses her job.
Terry is attracted to Marie and eventually talks her into a date. He also gets her hired by businessman John P. Schuyler, whom he had earlier saved from a live electrical wire.
When Marie runs into Nicky later, she lets slip that her new employer is expecting a delivery of $90,000 in bonds. As a result, Nicky is able to fool the courier into thinking he is Schuyler and giving him the bonds while Marie is distracted by a flood of calls from his accomplices. When she realizes what has happened, she goes looking for Nicky, but this only serves to make her look guilty. Terry is questioned by the police and then released so he can lead them to her hiding place. It works and she is arrested.
When an expensive lawyer shows up on her behalf, Terry becomes suspicious and taps his line with John's reluctant help. Finally, he is able to trace a call to where Nicky and his gang are hiding out. When he goes there, he is easily caught and placed in a bedroom after the phone is ripped out. However, he is not searched. He hooks up a spare phone he has and is able to contact John to bring help.

Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and find themselves in the "war-zone" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire out of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers. The two drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed.
Meanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White, almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the owner of the car, and therefore presumed to be the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City. As Sherman is brought to his knees, New York City fragments into different factions who use the case to suit their own cynical purposes.

Input: Passage: During an expedition into Central Africa, paleontologist Dr. Susan Matthews-Loomis and her husband George Loomis attempt to track down evidence of a local monster legend. The monster, which the local natives refer to as Mokele-mbembe, shares many characteristics with the Sauropod order of dinosaurs. During the expedition, they discover Brontosaurs in the deep jungle and are further amazed when the animals show very little fear of them. The couple begins observing the creatures and become especially enamored with the curious young offspring of the pair, whom they nickname "Baby". Unfortunately, the discovery soon places the dinosaurs in jeopardy from both the local military as well as fellow scientist Dr. Eric Kiviat. 
Whereas Dr. Kiviat sees Baby and his parents as his ticket to fame & fortune, the African military led by Colonel Nsogbu sees the dinosaurs as a threat and makes several attempts to destroy them. During one such attempt, one of the adult Brontosaurs is killed and the other captured. The Loomises are able to escape with Baby, but quickly find themselves lost in the jungle while being pursued by Colonel Nsogbu's forces. After finally escaping their pursuers, the pair decide to circle back and rescue the captive parent, whom Dr. Kiviat has persuaded Nsogbu to transport back to civilization.
With the aid of the local tribe - who see Baby and his parents as legends - George and Susan are able to break into the military compound and release the adult Brontosaur. During the escape, both Kiviat and Nsogbu are killed. Afterwards, the Loomises take the pair to a secluded jungle lagoon and say a tearful goodbye to Baby as he follows his lone parent away into the deeper parts of the jungle.

Input: Passage: Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death.
The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts.
In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United States between 1948 and 1950 and her many visits to continental Europe.
Ferrier was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 1951. In between periods of hospitalisation and convalescence she continued to perform and record; her final public appearance was as Orfeo, at the Royal Opera House in February 1953, eight months before her death. Among her many memorials, the Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund was launched in May 1954.  The Kathleen Ferrier Scholarship Fund, administered by the Royal Philharmonic Society, has since 1956 made annual awards to aspiring young professional singers.

Input: Passage: The Stooges are wannabe detectives who inadvertently get their chance to crack a case in Scotland. They manage to stumble on a lead concerning the priceless Punjab diamond being stolen by a crook named Dapper. With dreams of becoming genuine detectives, the trio head for Squid McGuffy's cafe asking for the whereabouts of Dapper. They manage to convince everyone at the restaurant that they are actually police.
While searching several rooms above the cafe, the Stooges stumble on Dapper's moll, who hastily hides the Punjab diamond in a candy dish. The boys refuse to leave, suspecting Dapper will eventually show his face. While killing time, Shemp starts to flirt with the moll, and manages to swallow the ice along with some mints from the candy dish. The gal nearly has a nervous breakdown but quickly discovers the Stooges are not actually real detectives. She calls in Dapper and his henchman Muscles and frantically try to pry the diamond out of frazzled Shemp.
After all else fails, Dapper decides to cut him open. Moe and Larry are locked in a closet by Muscles while Shemp is tied down on a close by desk-turned-operating table. As luck would have it, there happen to be a bag of tools in the closet, which Moe and Larry use to saw their way out of the closet, and right into a gorilla's cage on the other side of the wall.

Input: Passage: As the British fleet closed with the opposing combined fleets of France and Spain, Lord Nelson signalled all the necessary battle instructions to his ships. Aware of the momentousness of events to come, Lord Nelson felt that something extra was required. He instructed his signal officer, Lieutenant John Pasco, to signal to the fleet, as quickly as possible, the message "England confides that every man will do his duty." Pasco suggested to Nelson that expects be substituted for confides (i.e. is confident), since the former word was in the signal book, whereas confides would have to be spelt out letter-by-letter. Nelson agreed to the change (even though it produced a less trusting impression):
His Lordship came to me on the poop, and after ordering certain signals to be made, about a quarter to noon, he said, 'Mr. Pasco, I wish to say to the fleet, ENGLAND CONFIDES THAT EVERY MAN WILL DO HIS DUTY' and he added 'You must be quick, for I have one more to make which is for close action.' I replied, 'If your Lordship will permit me to substitute the confides for expects the signal will soon be completed, because the word expects is in the vocabulary, and confides must be spelt,' His Lordship replied, in haste, and with seeming satisfaction, 'That will do, Pasco, make it directly.'
Thus, at around 11:45 a.m. on 21 October 1805, the signal was sent. The exact time the signal was sent is not known (one account puts it as early as 10:30), as the message was repeated throughout the fleet, but Pasco puts it at "about a quarter to noon" and logs from other ships of the line also put it close to this time. 
Question: What is the full name of the person who came to Pasco on the poop, and ordered certain signals to be made, about a quarter to noon?

Input: Passage: By the late 1950s, Covent Garden was gradually abandoning its policy of productions in the vernacular; such singers as Maria Callas would not relearn their roles in English. This made it easier for Tucker to point up the difference between the two London opera companies. While Covent Garden engaged international stars, Sadler's Wells focused on young British and Commonwealth performers. Colin Davis was appointed musical director in succession to Gibson in 1961. The repertoire continued to mix familiar and unfamiliar operas. Novelties in Davis's time included Pizzetti's Murder in the Cathedral, Stravinsky's Oedipus rex, Richard Rodney Bennett's The Mines of Sulphur and more Janáček. Sadler's Wells's traditional policy of giving all operas in English continued, with only two exceptions: Oedipus rex, which was sung in Latin, and Monteverdi's L'Orfeo, sung in Italian, for reasons not clear to the press. In January 1962, the company gave its first Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Iolanthe, on the day on which the Savoy operas came out of copyright and the D'Oyly Carte monopoly ended.  The production was well received (it was successfully revived for many seasons until 1978) and was followed by a production of The Mikado in May of the same year.The Islington theatre was by now clearly too small to allow the company to achieve any further growth. A study conducted for the Arts Council reported that in the late 1960s the two Sadler's Wells companies comprised 278 salaried performers and 62 guest singers. The company had experience of playing in a large West End theatre, such as its 1958 sell-out production of The Merry Widow that had transferred to the 2,351-seat London Coliseum for a summer season. Ten years later, the lease of the Coliseum became available.  Stephen Arlen, who had succeeded Tucker as managing director, was the primary advocate for moving the company. After intense negotiations and fund-raising, a ten-year lease was signed in 1968.  One of the company's last productions at the Islington theatre was Wagner's The Mastersingers, conducted by Goodall in 1968, which 40 years later was described by Gramophone magazine as "legendary". The company left Sadler's Wells with a revival of the work with which it had re-opened the theatre in 1945, Peter Grimes. Its last performance at the Rosebery Avenue theatre was on 15 June 1968.

Input: Passage: In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: "But the lack of this aural stimulation – of Shakespeare's eloquent words – is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: "Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order."A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony.
Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence and music himself, even when his right hand was virtually unusable. This is a last hallmark of his extraordinarily determined and tenacious character.
He was survived by his third wife, Irina; his daughter, Galina; and his son, Maxim, a pianist and conductor who was the dedicatee and first performer of some of his father's works. Shostakovich himself left behind several recordings of his own piano works; other noted interpreters of his music include Emil Gilels, Mstislav Rostropovich, Tatiana Nikolayeva, Maria Yudina, David Oistrakh, and members of the Beethoven Quartet.
His last work was his Viola Sonata, which was first performed on 28 December 1975, four months after his death.

Response list: ['Shostakovich.']

Input: Passage: U.S. Army Air Forces fighter pilot Johnny Martin is diagnosed with nerve exhaustion at his discharge medical and is prevented from flying for a year. Instead he goes home with one of the other pilots, Miles Cary, to his hometown in Iowa. While Miles returns to his family and his job at the bank, Johnny has a hard time adapting to the tedious ordinary life in the small town and starts working as a bus driver. One day he quits his job. 
Joe Patillo, his other pilot buddy from the Army, is planning to start flying again, using a surplus Douglas C-47 transport aircraft. Johnny and Miles both agree to join Joe in California where Joe lives, and get their first job, to fly to New York.
Since Johnny is forbidden to fly, Miles and Joe fly the C-47 to New York. Miles's wife Sally is anxious about him flying again and asks why Johnny is not flying. Ashamed over his inability to fly. Johnny lies, telling Sally that he needs to work with the administration and marketing of the company.
Joe and Miles return with a passenger in the aircraft, Anne Cummings. Johnny is upset since he was not informed, and does not calm down knowing Anne paid for the trip. He is further upset when he finds out that Anne is hired as the new company mechanic.

Input: Passage: Sir Michael Kemp Tippett  (2 January 1905 – 8 January 1998) was an English composer who rose to prominence during and immediately after the  Second World War. In his lifetime he was sometimes  ranked with his contemporary Benjamin Britten as one of the leading British composers of the 20th century. Among his best-known works are the oratorio A Child of Our Time, the orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, and the opera The Midsummer Marriage.
Tippett's talent developed slowly. He withdrew or destroyed his earliest compositions, and was 30 before any of his works were published. Until the mid-to-late 1950s his music was broadly lyrical in character, before changing to a more astringent and experimental style. New influences, including those of jazz and blues after his first visit to America in 1965, became increasingly evident in his compositions. While Tippett's stature with the public continued to grow, not all critics approved of these changes in style, some believing that the quality of his work suffered as a consequence. From around 1976 Tippett's late works began to reflect the works of his youth through a return to lyricism. Although he was much honoured in his lifetime, critical judgement on Tippett's legacy has been uneven, the greatest praise being generally reserved for his earlier works. His centenary in 2005 was a muted affair; apart from the few best-known works, his music has been performed  infrequently in the 21st century.
Having briefly embraced communism in the 1930s, Tippett avoided identifying with any political party. A pacifist after 1940, he was imprisoned in 1943 for refusing to carry out war-related duties required by his military exemption. His initial difficulties in accepting his  homosexuality led him in 1939 to Jungian psychoanalysis; the Jungian dichotomy of "shadow" and "light" remained a recurring factor in his music. He was a strong advocate of music education, and was active for much of his life as a radio broadcaster and writer on music. 
Question: What is the last name of the person who was 30 before any of his works were published?
Response list: ['Tippett.']

Input: Passage: The yellowhammer is a conspicuous, vocal and formerly common country bird, and has attracted human interest. Yellowham Wood and Yellowham Hill, near Dorchester, both derive their names from the bird. Robbie Burns' poem "The Yellow, Yellow Yorlin'" gets its title from a Scottish name for the yellowhammer, which is given an obvious sexual connotation: I met a pretty maid, an' unto her I said,/ "I wad fain fin' your yellow, yellow yorlin'." More factual descriptions of the bird and its behaviour can be found in John Clare's "The Yellowhammer's Nest" and "The Yellowhammer", whose final lines read:
Enid Blyton helped to popularise the bird's song as "little bit of bread and no cheese" in books such as The Ship of Adventure and Five Go Off in a Caravan, and wrote a poem called "The Yellow-hammer".
Beethoven's student, Carl Czerny, and biographer Anton Schindler, both suggested that the composer got the idea for the first four notes of his 5th symphony from the yellowhammer's call, although it is more likely that the opening of the 4th Piano Concerto was actually the work in question. Beethoven also used the yellowhammer theme in two piano sonatas, no. 21 in C major (the "Waldstein", Op.53) and No. 23 in F minor (the "Appassionata", Op.57).Olivier Messiaen often used birdsong as an inspiration for his music, and the yellowhammer features in Chronochromie, Catalogue d'oiseaux, La fauvette des jardins and Méditations sur le mystère de la Sainte Trinité, appearing in four movements of the last piece.An old legend links the yellowhammer to the Devil. Its tongue was supposed to bear a drop of his blood, and the intricate pattern on the eggs was said to carry a concealed, possibly evil, message; these satanic associations sometimes led to the persecution of the bird. The unusual appearance of the eggs also led to "scribble lark", an old name for the bird.

Input: Passage: When Mary Beekman loses her waitress job, after a fight with her loutish boyfriend, trucker Mike O'Reilly she stands at a bridge on a windy night, losing her pay check through a windblown and leans over the guardrail of the bridge to catch it. Socialite Kenneth Alden catches her, thinking she wants to jump the bridge. He's lost everything that is not already mortgaged. Both down on their luck, they assume that the other is there to jump off the bridge.
Instead, Mary has an idea. If Ken sells shares to a syndicate of his wealthy friends, in a phoney beauty product, they'll have enough money for some clothes to pass Mary off in society, long enough to meet and marry a wealthy bachelor. Then, they can pay everyone back, with interest. The con might work, except that Ken has too much integrity to marry for money to Clarissa (whom he loves for years), and Mary is beginning to see his point when she falls for Pat, who has secrets of his own.
The plot boils over when Mike shows up to blow the lid off. Pat's valet is a thief, who promised not to act foolishly. But he escapes with a stolen Tiara. Meantime Mary thinks to leave as things do not work out, so she shares the taxi to the station with Pat's valet escaping with the Tiara. After a police chase, Mary is hauled off to the station.
It looks like no one is going to end up with anything, but a bad reputation; but, it's not over yet, in this curious, romantic comedy, about the social set, in 1930's America, from Chesterfield films.

Input: Passage: "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" was written by Beyoncé, Terius "The-Dream" Nash, Thaddis "Kuk" Harrell, and Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized "Single Ladies" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was "the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that "people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate". She stated that although "Single Ladies" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In "Single Ladies", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce. The song was released simultaneously with "If I Were a Boy"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; "Single Ladies" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; "Single Ladies" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while "If I Were a Boy" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio. The two songs were released as a double A-side single on November 7, 2008, in Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. Dance remixes of the song were made available in the US on February 10, 2009, and in Europe on February 16, 2009. "Single Ladies" was not originally released as a single in the UK, but the song became increasingly popular there and reached the top ten in the UK Singles Chart as a result of download sales. On February 16, 2009, it was released as a CD single, and the dance remixes became available as a digital download.

Input: Passage: Teenaged brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World, a dinosaur theme park at the original Jurassic Park site on Isla Nublar. Their aunt, Claire Dearing, is the operations manager. Claire assigns her assistant, Zara, as the boys' guide but they soon evade her. Elsewhere on the island, U.S. Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady has been training and researching four Velociraptors. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, Vic Hoskins, the head of InGen Security, believes the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant Barry strongly oppose.
Prior to its opening, Claire and park owner Simon Masrani inspect the park's newest attraction, Indominus rex, a genetically-engineered dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure. Owen warns Claire the Indominus lacks social skills, making it more dangerous and unpredictable. When it appears the Indominus has escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. The Indominus, which can camouflage itself and mask its heat signature, suddenly appears. Owen survives the attack, but it kills the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Owen tells Masrani to have the Indominus killed; to protect his company's investment, Masrani instead dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with non-lethal weaponry. After most of the unit is wiped out, Claire orders the evacuation of the island's northern sector.

Input: Passage: Balch Creek begins in the Forest Park neighborhood in unincorporated Multnomah County near the intersection of Northwest Skyline Boulevard and Northwest Thompson Road at the crest of the West Hills. It flows generally east about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) to its confluence with the Willamette River, a major tributary of the Columbia River. The creek drops from 1,116 feet (340 m) above sea level at its source to 46 feet (14 m) at its mouth, a total of 1,070 feet (330 m). Most of this occurs in the first 2.5 miles (4.0 km). In the hills, the stream gradient (slope) generally ranges from 15 to 30 percent interspersed with sections of less than 15 percent along the middle reaches.From its source, the creek runs east on private property near Forest Park, a large municipal park in Portland, before turning briefly south about 3 miles (5 km) from the mouth. Soon thereafter, the stream receives an unnamed tributary on the right bank and turns southeast on private property along Northwest Cornell Road. It enters the city and the Audubon Society of Portland simultaneously about 2 miles (3 km) from the mouth, receives two more unnamed tributaries on the right, and flows northeast, entering the part of Forest Park known as Macleay Park.For about 0.25 miles (0.40 km) the creek parallels Wildwood Trail, the main hiking trail in Forest Park, until reaching a former public restroom known as the Stone House. From here Balch Creek runs beside the Lower Macleay Trail, another hiking trail, for about 0.8 miles (1.3 km). Near Northwest Thurman Street, roughly 1 mile (1.6 km) from the mouth, the creek flows through a trash rack into an 84-inch (210 cm) diameter storm sewer. City workers first diverted the creek into a pipe in the early 20th century. The water empties into the Willamette River in the city's Northwest Industrial neighborhood at Outfall 17. About 10 miles (16 km) below this outfall, the Willamette enters the Columbia River.

Input: Passage: The wide variety of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has been found to be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 discovered the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).Fish are plentiful in the waters surrounding the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African red snappers (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.
The sandbar of Carabane has very few mammals other than pets, although the French first noted the presence of monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.On an island called Ilha dos Mosquitos (Portuguese for "Mosquito Island"), the natives and their visitors continue to protect themselves with mosquito nets and Shea butter. They must also protect themselves from other, smaller insects which are no less troublesome: black flies (Simulium).

Input: Passage: Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi (Italian: [ˈklaudjo monteˈverdi] (listen); 15 May 1567 (baptized) – 29 November 1643) was an Italian composer, string player and choirmaster. A composer of both secular and sacred music, and a pioneer in the development of opera, he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque periods of music history.
Born in Cremona, where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua (c. 1590–1613) and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was maestro di capella at the basilica of San Marco. His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period, including problems of income, patronage and politics.
Much of Monteverdi's output, including many stage works, has been lost. His surviving music includes nine books of madrigals, large-scale sacred works such as his Vespro della Beata Vergine (Vespers) of 1610, and three complete operas. His opera L'Orfeo (1607) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed; towards the end of his life he wrote works for the commercial theatre in Venice, including Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione di Poppea.
While he worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance polyphony, such as in his madrigals, he undertook great developments in form and melody, and began to employ the basso continuo technique, distinctive of the Baroque. No stranger to controversy, he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a seconda pratica, contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the prima pratica. Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries, his works enjoyed a rediscovery around the beginning of the twentieth century. He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded.

Input: Passage: Matt Franklin is a recent MIT graduate who works at a Los Angeles Suncoast Video store in 1988 while trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life, something that his police officer father has grown impatient with. While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home.
Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesn't think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend graduate school at the University of Cambridge. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in Beverly Hills. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along. Barry has a wild sexual encounter with an older woman while Matt and Tori continue to mingle with each other, after Matt's successful 'put down' of Tori's boss, a habitual sexual harasser.

They are staying at the Tregarron guesthouse in the (fictional) seaside town of Easton in Suffolk. This traditional English boarding house is owned and run by the formidable  Miss Wilbraham.   
On arrival, Richard befriends Edwin, who is girl-crazy and takes Richard under his wing. In search of girls, Richard and Edwin attend a beach service organized by the local church  youth group. After the type of evening one might expect at such a gathering, they enjoy a brief tryst with the twin daughters of the minister. 
The following evening another visitor, Julia, agrees to a date with Edwin but only on condition that Anna, her Dutch foreign exchange student friend, can join them. Edwin persuades Richard to join them to make up a foursome. Escaping from his parents on the pretence that the quartet is heading to the youth group's Sausage Sizzle, Richard and his friends visit a local jazz club instead. 
Anna attempts to sneak away with some local bikers and Richard gives chase. As Anna rides away on the back of one biker's machine, Richard jumps on the other. The bikes race off into the sand dunes; where Richard and Anna fall off the pillions and into each other's arms. Richard is annoyed but Anna finds the whole affair amusing. Reaching for a handkerchief to clean a cut on his head, Richard also pulls out a condom that he has taken from Edwin's room.
Julia and Edwin, meanwhile, have been to fetch help. Julia's father, Richard's parents and the minister from the youth group set off to rescue Richard and Anna.

Input: Passage: Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had "a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, "Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford." While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

Input: Passage: Their records have been heavily influenced by the "motorik" technique of 1970s krautrock groups such as Neu! and Faust. Tim Gane has supported the comparison: "Neu! did minimalism and drones, but in a very pop way." Dave Heaton of PopMatters said that their music also had "echoes of bubblegum, of exotica, of Beach Boys and bossa nova", with their earlier work "bearing strong Velvet Underground overtones". Funk, jazz, and Brazilian music were additional inspirations for the band. Stephan Davet of French newspaper Le Monde said that Emperor Tomato Ketchup (1996) had musical influences such as Burt Bacharach, and Françoise Hardy. The sounds influenced by minimalist composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich can be found on the 1999 album Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night. The same album, according to Rick Reger of Chicago Tribune, "charts [a course] somewhere between the Beach Boys and Kraftwerk." Stereolab's style also incorporates easy-listening music of the 1950s and '60s. Barney Hoskyns wrote in a review for Dots and Loops (1997) that the group moved "away from the one-chord Velvets drone-mesh of its early days" toward easy-listening and Europop. Joshua Klein in Washington Post said that, "Years before everyone else caught on, Stereolab [were] referencing the 1970s German bands Can and Neu!, the Mexican lounge music master Esquivel and the decidedly unhip Burt Bacharach." Regarding their later work such as Instant 0 in the Universe (2003) and Margerine Eclipse (2004), critics have compared the releases to the band's earlier guitar-driven style. 
Question: What band has musical influences such as Burt Bacharach?
Response list: ['Emperor Tomato Ketchup.']

Input: Passage: Oliver was born Bronwyn Gooda on 22 February 1959, in Gum Flat, west of Inverell, in New South Wales. Her parents were Milton, a farmer turned greenkeeper, and Wendy, who worked in a pharmacy. Her creativity was nurtured from a young age. Aged just eight, Oliver attended weekend art classes in Inverell run by Ian Howard, who went on to become dean of the college in Sydney where she would later study. As she was dux of her school, her parents expected her to go on to university. However, Oliver wished to pursue a creative career. When she told her parents of her plans, her mother replied, "Darling, your father and I are very pleased you're going to art school, but if you'd been a son, I think we'd be a little disappointed." A rift subsequently developed between her and her family that resulted in her having no contact with them for 25 years.After leaving school, Oliver studied and worked in Sydney. She had intended to enrol in painting classes, but a computer error placed her in the sculpture course: she later said "I knew straight away I was in the right place".She graduated from the Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education in 1980. Winning a New South Wales Travelling Art Scholarship in 1983, she then completed a master's degree at Chelsea School of Art in 1984. Her work was influenced by Richard Deacon, Antony Gormley and Martin Puryear under whom she studied while in England. Upon returning from the United Kingdom, she immediately met with further success, when in 1984 she won a Moet & Chandon Australian Art Fellowship. In 1988 she was granted a period as artist-in-residence in the city of Brest on the coast of Brittany, where she studied Celtic metalworking techniques.

Input: Passage: The Namesake depicts the struggles of Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli (Irrfan Khan and Tabu), first-generation immigrants from the East Indian state of West Bengal to the United States, and their American-born children Gogol and Sonia. The film takes place primarily in Kolkata, New York City and New York state suburbs.
The story begins as Ashoke and Ashima leave Calcutta and settle in New York City. Through a series of miscues, their son's nickname, Gogol (named after Ukrainian author Nikolai Gogol), becomes his official birth name, an event which will shape many aspects of his life. The story chronicles Gogol's cross-cultural experiences and his exploration of his Indian heritage, as the story shifts between the United States and India. 
Gogol becomes a lazy, pot smoking teenager indifferent to his cultural background. He resents many of the customs and traditions his family upholds and doesn't understand his parents. After a summer trip to India before starting college at Yale, Gogol starts opening up to his culture and becomes more accepting of it. 
After college, Gogol uses his "good name" Nikhil (later shortened to Nick). He works as an architect and dates Maxine, a white woman from a wealthy background, who is clueless about their cultural differences. Gogol falls in love with Maxine and introduces her to his parents, who struggle to understand his modern, American perspectives on dating, marriage and love. They are hesitant and guarded when meeting her. Gogol gets along with Maxine's family and feels closer to them than he does his own family.

Input: Passage: The Rwandan government, through its Sports Development Policy, promotes sport as a strong avenue for "development and peace building", and the government has made commitments to advancing the use of sport for a variety of development objectives, including education. The most popular sports in Rwanda are association football, volleyball, basketball, athletics and Paralympic sports. Cricket has been growing in popularity, as a result of refugees returned from Kenya, where they had learned to play the game. Cycling, traditionally seen largely as a mode of transport in Rwanda, is also growing in popularity as a sport; and Team Rwanda have been the subject of a book, Land of Second Chances: The Impossible Rise of Rwanda's Cycling Team and a film, Rising from Ashes.Rwandans have been competing at the Olympic Games since 1984, and the Paralympic Games since 2004. The country sent seven competitors to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, representing it in athletics, swimming, mountain biking and judo, and 15 competitors to the London Summer Paralympics to compete in athletics, powerlifting and sitting volleyball. The country has also participated in the Commonwealth Games since joining the Commonwealth in 2009. The country's national basketball team has been growing in prominence since the mid-2000s, with the men's team qualifying for the final stages of the African Basketball Championship four times in a row since 2007.

Input: Passage: Fodor's Chicago 2010 ranks the hotel as having one of the best spas and one of the best pools in the city. It also ranked the hotel as a Fodor's Choice among Chicago lodging options.  Fodor's also notes that the hotel has impeccable service and lavish amenities, but also notes that the hotel may be a bit "too decadent", with offerings such as $25 bottles of water.Frommer's Chicago 2010 describes the hotel as having the gorgeous views and upscale amenities to provide a place to go to live the life of a wealthy tourist. The building is praised for its location, which provides as many views along the Chicago River as possible. Its modern architecture is praised for "contemporary synthesis of adjacent building fabrics and modulations" that preserve the city's architectural heritage and integrate the riverfront setting.BlackBook Magazine's Guide to Chicago describes the Hotel as an embodiment of poshness which gives the visitor bragging rights upon his/her return home.Forbes Travel Guide describes the hotel as having an understated upscale lobby, sophisticated lounge, gorgeous restaurant and lavish rooms with amazing views.  It also describes the hotel as befitting of the Trump name in several ways.Time Out describes the building as a "testament to a vibrant 21st-century optimism in Chicago". It notes that the hotel meets all expectations attached to the name Trump in terms of luxury, modern conveniences and speaks highly of the views.Insight Guides describes the building's architectural swagger as fitting for the post-September 11 attacks skyline. Ten years after the September 11 attacks, Kamin described the building as the one that "best reveals how the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks either did or did not change architecture". Kamin clarified his belief:
Simply by virtue of standing there—and by being the tallest American building built since the 1974 completion of Sears (now Willis) Tower—Trump confounds those who predicted after 9/11 that iconic skyscrapers would never be built again. At the same time, Trump's height—originally pegged at more than 2,000 feet but eventually scaled back to 1,362 feet—suggests that the fear spawned by the attacks did have some effect.

Input: Passage: Agent Bart Langner finds Elsa Brinkmann, a would-be actress who looks and sounds just like  Lylah Clare, a flamboyant star who fell to her death in suspicious circumstances 20 years ago. He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan, who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah. 
Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella. As filming continues, her identification with her rôle gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished. 
By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella.
A final sequence (in this case, a TV commercial for dog food that interrupts the film itself) suggests that the world of Hollywood is literally one of dog eats dog.

Input: Passage: Karluk had been chosen by Pedersen and bought by Stefansson for the bargain price of US$10,000. Stefansson was advised by Pedersen that, of four ships that were available, Karluk was "the soundest and best adapted for our purpose", but Bartlett had deep reservations about her fitness for prolonged Arctic service. The ship, a 29-year-old brigantine, was 129 feet (39 m) in length with a beam of 23 feet (7.0 m). She had been built for the Aleutian fishing industry (karluk is the Aleut word for "fish") and later converted for whaling, when her bows and sides had been sheathed with 2-inch (51 mm) Australian ironwood. Despite 14 arctic whaling voyages, including six overwinterings, she had not been built to withstand sustained ice pressure, and lacked the engine power to force a passage through the ice. She did not match the expectations of Bartlett, or of many of the more experienced crew.The ship spent most of April and May 1913 undergoing repairs and refitting at the dockyard in Esquimalt. When Bartlett arrived in early June he immediately ordered further repair work. In addition to Karluk, Stefansson had purchased sight unseen a small gasoline-driven schooner, Alaska, to act as a supply ship for the Southern Party. He later added a second schooner, Mary Sachs, when the hold space in Alaska proved inadequate. In the confusion surrounding the expedition's departure, McKinlay notes, no attempt was made to align men or equipment to their appropriate ships. Thus anthropologists Henri Beuchat and Diamond Jenness, both designated for the Southern Party, found themselves sailing with Karluk, while their equipment was on board Alaska. McKinlay himself, aboard Karluk as magnetic observer, discovered that most of his equipment was with Alaska. Stefansson insisted that all would be sorted out when the ships reached their Herschel Island rendezvous. "Heaven help us all if we failed to reach Herschel Island", McKinlay wrote. 
Question: What were the names of the three ships bought by Stefansson?

Input: Passage: After their HIV positive mother's death, Derick and Margaret collect wood and construct a human-length box with wheels. Then, they journey with it from Kampala to Kasangombe in a heartbreaking bid to overcome poverty and experience hope. The journey throws them dangerous experiences on unpredictable Ugandan roads. Their mother's dying wish had set them off on a seemingly impossible journey to find a relative they do not even know.
Before her death, she leaves them an envelope addressed to her sister (their auntie) who is married to a hard-working man living in a distant village called Kasangombe with their kids. Ingeniously, Derick creates a coffin using wood he collected from a rubbish dump and adds luggage bag rollers brought by Margaret. On their journey from Kampala City to their aunt's place, they are offered a lift by a seemingly kind man (played by Joel Okuyo Atiku) in a truck who is amazed by their "box". He introduces them to a kid he had taken under his wings relaxing at the back and shows them a photo of a house they can possess if they work for him. At night though, Margaret sees a scary dream where their helper is not exactly as kind as he seemed so she runs out of the truck. Derick follows and the boy throws out their coffin before waving. They walk the rest of the distance.
Initially, their uncle (played by Isaac Muwawu) did not want them in his house because he thought they were HIV-infected. Derick overheard him quarrel with his aunt at night and shook Margaret in the morning from another dream (this time beautiful, where both siblings were smiling and enjoying a picnic in a glorious garden with their aunt, uncle, cousins, dead parents and some whites). Derick convinced her to walk away from the home with him but without a reason.

Input: Passage: Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his Bar Mitzvah. Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the New York-based Jewish Defense League. Time magazine quoted him saying about Kahane, "He's a really sincere guy. He's really put it all together." Subsequently, Dylan downplayed the extent of his contact with Kahane.
During the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the Vineyard School of Discipleship. Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: "Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord." From January to March 1979, Dylan attended the Vineyard Bible study classes in Reseda, California.By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the "born again" label. He told Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone magazine: "I've never said I'm born again. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come." In response to Loder's asking whether he belonged to any church or synagogue, Dylan laughingly replied, "Not really. Uh, the Church of the Poison Mind."When it was asked of Dylan in a 1986 press conference in Australia "How much do you feel you are a vessel, a medium for a higher power, for God, that it [the music] flows through you... for Him?" Dylan replied, "Well I feel that way about most of the stuff that I do."In 1997, he told David Gates of Newsweek:
Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else. Songs like "Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain" or "I Saw the Light"—that's my religion. I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.

Input: Passage: (English: "The Marriage of Thetis")
After Duke Vincenzo's death in February 1612, Monteverdi found himself out of favour at the Mantuan court. Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide "if you tell me to do so". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi. He informed Striggio that what he had first considered a rather monotonous piece he now thought fully appropriate to the occasion. He began work on the recitative sections, but before he could start setting the more expressive numbers, the duke had a change of heart and cancelled Monteverdi's commission. Le nozze di Tetide was abandoned; its libretto and whatever music existed have disappeared. 
Question: What is the last name of the person who remained in contact with Striggio?
Response list: ['Monteverdi.']
Ground truth: Monteverdi.

Input: Passage: In the 14th century, diplomatic contact continued between the Franks and the Mongols, until the Ilkhanate dissolved in the 1330s, and the ravages of the Black Death in Europe caused contact with the East to be severed. A few marital alliances between Christian rulers and the Mongols of the Golden Horde continued, such as when the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II gave daughters in marriage to Toqto'a (d. 1312) and later to his successor Uzbek (1312–1341).After Abu Sa'id, relations between Christian princes and the Ilkhanate became very sparse. Abu Sa'id died in 1335 with neither heir nor successor, and the Ilkhanate lost its status after his death, becoming a plethora of little kingdoms run by Mongols, Turks, and Persians.In 1336, an embassy to the French Pope Benedict XII in Avignon was sent by Toghun Temür, the last Yuan emperor in Dadu. The embassy was led by two Genoese travelers in the service of the Mongol emperor, who carried letters representing that the Mongols had been eight years (since Archbishop John of Montecorvino's death) without a spiritual guide, and earnestly desired one. Pope Benedict appointed four ecclesiastics as his legates to the khan's court. In 1338, a total of 50 ecclesiastics were sent by the pope to Peking, among them John of Marignolli, who returned to Avignon in 1353 with a letter from the Yuan emperor to Pope Innocent VI. But soon, the Han Chinese rose up and drove the Mongols out of China, establishing the Ming Dynasty in 1368. By 1369, all foreign influences, from Mongols to Christians, Manichaeans, and Buddhists, were expelled by the Ming Dynasty.
In the early 15th century, Timur (Tamerlane) resumed relations with Europe, attempting to form an alliance against the Egyptian Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire, and engaged in communications with Charles VI of France and Henry III of Castile, but died in 1405. 
Question: What was the name of one of the 50 ecclesiastics sent by the pope to Peking who returned to Avignon in 1353 with a letter from the Yuan emperor to Pope Innocent VI?
Response list: ['John of Marignolli.']
Ground truth: Abu Sa'id.

Input: Passage: John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself "Anglus" or "Scotus", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest.  A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a "Mighell Wryghtt", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as "Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as "related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland." If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas. 
Question: What is the first name of the person who had at least one son with his wife?
Response list: ['Thomas.']
Ground truth: John.

Input: Passage: In his usurpation of the throne from the Jianwen Emperor (r. 1398–1402), the Yongle Emperor was aided by the Buddhist monk Yao Guangxiao, and like his father, the Hongwu Emperor, the Yongle Emperor was "well-disposed towards Buddhism", claims Rossabi. On March 10, 1403, the Yongle Emperor invited Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama (1384–1415), to his court, even though the fourth Karmapa had rejected the invitation of the Hongwu Emperor. A Tibetan translation in the 16th century preserves the letter of the Yongle Emperor, which the Association for Asian Studies notes is polite and complimentary towards the Karmapa. The letter of invitation reads,My father and both parents of the queen are now dead. You are my only hope, essence of buddhahood. Please come quickly. I am sending as offering a large ingot of silver, one hundred fifty silver coins, twenty rolls of silk, a block of sandalwood, one hundred fifty bricks of tea and ten pounds of incense."
In order to seek out the Karmapa, the Yongle Emperor dispatched his eunuch Hou Xian and the Buddhist monk Zhi Guang (d. 1435) to Tibet. Traveling to Lhasa either through Qinghai or via the Silk Road to Khotan, Hou Xian and Zhi Guang did not return to Nanjing until 1407.
The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC preserves an edict of the Zhengtong Emperor (r. 1435–1449) addressed to the Karmapa in 1445, written after the latter's agent had brought holy relics to the Ming court. Zhengtong had the following message delivered to the Great Treasure Prince of Dharma, the Karmapa:
Out of compassion, Buddha taught people to be good and persuaded them to embrace his doctrines. You, who live in the remote Western Region, have inherited the true Buddhist doctrines. I am deeply impressed not only by the compassion with which you preach among the people in your region for their enlightenment, but also by your respect for the wishes of Heaven and your devotion to the Court. I am very pleased that you have sent bSod-nams-nyi-ma and other Tibetan monks here bringing with them statues of Buddha, horses and other specialties as tributes to the court.
Despite this glowing message by the Emperor, Chan writes that a year later in 1446, the Ming court cut off all relations with the Karmapa hierarchs. Until then, the court was unaware that Deshin Shekpa had died in 1415. The Ming court had believed that the representatives of the Karma Kagyu who continued to visit the Ming capital were sent by the Karmapa. 
Question: What is the full name of the person who was sent ten pounds of incense with an invitation?
Response list: ['Yongle Emperor.']
Ground truth: Deshin Shekpa.

Input: Passage: The book Elvis: What Happened?, co-written by the three bodyguards fired the previous year, was published on August 1. It was the first exposé to detail Presley's years of drug misuse. He was devastated by the book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to the publishers. By this point, he suffered from multiple ailments: glaucoma, high blood pressure, liver damage, and an enlarged colon, each magnified—and possibly caused—by drug abuse.On the evening of Tuesday, August 16, 1977, Presley was scheduled to fly out of Memphis to begin another tour. That afternoon, Ginger Alden discovered him in an unresponsive state on a bathroom floor. According to her eyewitness account, "Elvis looked as if his entire body had completely frozen in a seated position while using the commode and then had fallen forward, in that fixed position, directly in front of it. [...] It was clear that, from the time whatever hit him to the moment he had landed on the floor, Elvis hadn't moved." Attempts to revive him failed, and his death was officially pronounced at 3:30 p.m. at the Baptist Memorial Hospital.President Jimmy Carter issued a statement that credited Presley with having "permanently changed the face of American popular culture". Thousands of people gathered outside Graceland to view the open casket. One of Presley's cousins, Billy Mann, accepted $18,000 to secretly photograph the corpse; the picture appeared on the cover of the National Enquirer's biggest-selling issue ever. Alden struck a $105,000 deal with the Enquirer for her story, but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement. Presley left her nothing in his will.Presley's funeral was held at Graceland on Thursday, August 18. Outside the gates, a car plowed into a group of fans, killing two women and critically injuring a third. About 80,000 people lined the processional route to Forest Hill Cemetery, where Presley was buried next to his mother. Within a few weeks, "Way Down" topped the country and U.K. pop charts. Following an attempt to steal Presley's body in late August, the remains of both Presley and his mother were reburied in Graceland's Meditation Garden on October 2.

Input: Passage: Sailors on nearby ships heard the series of signals and, realizing that a collision was imminent, gathered to watch as Imo bore down on Mont-Blanc. Both ships had cut their engines by this point, but their momentum carried them right on top of each other at slow speed. Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock that would set off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered Mont-Blanc to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the bow of Imo in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship's height in the water and the transverse thrust of her right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into Mont-Blanc. Imo's prow pushed into the No. 1 hold of Mont Blanc, on her starboard side.The collision occurred at 8:45 am. The damage to Mont Blanc was not severe, but barrels of deck cargo toppled and broke open.  This flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imo's engines kicked in, she disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blanc's hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly up the side of the ship. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.Towing two scows at the time of the collision, Stella Maris responded immediately to the fire, anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6 to spray the burning ship with their fire hose. The tug's captain, Horatio H. Brannen, and his crew realized that the fire was too intense for their single hose and backed off from the burning Mont Blanc. They were approached by a whaler from HMS Highflyer and later a steam pinnace belonging to HMCS Niobe. Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of Niobe agreed to secure a line to the French ship's stern so as to pull it away from the pier to avoid setting it on fire. The five-inch (127-millimetre) hawser initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a ten-inch (254-millimetre) hawser came down. It was at this point that the blast occurred. 
Question: What is the last name of the captain that agreed to secure a line to the ship that the people of Halifax watched burn?

Input: Passage: 4 received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 36 reviews. Michael Cragg of The Observer called it Beyoncé's "most accomplished album yet". Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson believed 4 succeeds vocally as an album of mostly intimate and slow-tempo ballads. Mikael Wood of Spin magazine applauded its ballads, mid-tempo songs, and evocations of late 1970s and early 1980s pop-soul. In his review for Rolling Stone, Jody Rosen wrote that Beyoncé eschews contemporary production styles for a more personal and idiosyncratic album. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times viewed it as a good showcase for Beyoncé as a torch singer, because she convincingly sings about heartbreak and the strong emotional effect of love. Pitchfork critic Ryan Dombal found it easygoing, retro-informed, and engaging because it shows "one of the world's biggest stars exploring her talent in ways few could've predicted". AllMusic's Andy Kellman said that the quality of Beyoncé's singing and the songwriting compensate for the assorted arrangement of the songs. Uncut viewed it is an exceptional album in spite of occasionally trite lyrics.In a less enthusiastic review, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly said the first half of 4 is marred by boring ballads and the songwriting in general are not on-par with Beyoncé's vocal talent. In his review for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis was ambivalent towards the album's 1980s influence and argued that, despite well written songs, it is not very consequential. Time magazine's Claire Suddath said the songs lack lyrical substance, even though they are performed well. Greg Kot, writing in the Chicago Tribune, called 4 inconsistent, short, and unfinished. NME magazine's Hamish MacBain felt Beyoncé did not progress from her past work and that "even the OK bits here" sounded "uninspired".

Input: Passage: An enchantress disguised as a beggar arrives at a French castle and offers a cruel and selfish prince a rose in return for shelter. When he refuses, she reveals her identity. To punish the prince for his lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the curse will only be broken if he learns to love another, and earn their love in return, before the last petal falls on his 21st birthday.
Ten years later, in a nearby village, a beautiful, young, book-loving woman named Belle dreams of adventure and brushes off advances from Gaston, a handsome, narcissistic and arrogant hunter. On his way to a fair and lost in the forest, Belle's father Maurice seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search for him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take Maurice's place.
Belle befriends the castle's servants, who invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. She is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, and is injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a friendship develops between them.

Input: Passage: As the national media descended on Beach Haven, Spring Lake, and Matawan, the Jersey Shore attacks started a shark panic. According to Capuzzo, this panic was "unrivaled in American history," "sweeping along the coasts of New York and New Jersey and spreading by telephone and wireless, letter and postcard." At first, after the Beach Haven incident, scientists and the press reluctantly blamed the death of Charles Vansant on a shark. The New York Times reported that Vansant "was badly bitten in the surf ... by a fish, presumably a shark." Still, State Fish Commissioner of Pennsylvania and former director of the Philadelphia Aquarium James M. Meehan asserted in the Philadelphia Public Ledger that the shark was preying on the dog, but bit Vansant by mistake. He specifically de-emphasized the threat sharks posed to humans:
Despite the death of Charles Vansant and the report that two sharks having been caught in that vicinity recently, I do not believe there is any reason why people should hesitate to go in swimming at the beaches for fear of man-eaters. The information in regard to the sharks is indefinite and I hardly believe that Vansant was bitten by a man-eater. Vansant was in the surf playing with a dog and it may be that a small shark had drifted in at high water, and was marooned by the tide. Being unable to move quickly and without food, he had come in to bite the dog and snapped at the man in passing.
The media's response to the second attack was more sensational. Major American newspapers such as the Boston Herald, Chicago Sun-Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Washington Post and San Francisco Chronicle placed the story on the front page. The New York Times' headline read, "Shark Kills Bather Off Jersey Beach". The growing panic had cost New Jersey resort owners an estimated $250,000 ($5,800,000 in 2018) in lost tourism, and sun bathing had declined by 75 percent in some areas. A press conference was convened on July 8, 1916, at the American Museum of Natural History with scientists Frederic Augustus Lucas, John Treadwell Nichols, and Robert Cushman Murphy as panelists. To calm the growing panic, the three men stressed that a third run in with a shark was unlikely, although they were admittedly surprised that sharks bit anyone at all. Nevertheless, Nichols—the only ichthyologist in the trio—warned swimmers to stay close to shore and to take advantage of the netted bathing areas installed at public beaches after the first attack.

Input: Passage: In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, "He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart." When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's "I'm Eighteen" on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon.Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together:
Early Seventies Britain was a very depressing place. It was completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from the wrong side of the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us.
Their first gig was arranged by Matlock, who was studying at Saint Martins College. The band played at the school on 6 November 1975, in support of a pub rock group called Bazooka Joe, arranging to use their amps and drums. The Sex Pistols performed several cover songs, including the Who's "Substitute", the Small Faces' "Whatcha Gonna Do About It", and "(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone", made famous by the Monkees; according to observers, they were unexceptional musically aside from being extremely loud. Before the Pistols could play the few original songs they had written to date, Bazooka Joe pulled the plugs as they saw their gear being trashed. A brief physical altercation between members of the two bands took place on stage.

Input: Passage: The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.

Input: Passage: Ricketts Glen State Park is in five townships in three counties. After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber. One squatter, Jesse Dodson, cut trees from around 1830 to 1860 and built a mill and the dam for what became Lake Rose in 1842. Dodson also built a dam south of Mud Pond, near what became Lake Jean; both dams were on the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek, and each was used to make a "log splash pond". The other squatter, named Sickler, also built a mill and log dam, at what became Lake Leigh on the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. Sickler was active from 1838 to about 1860.In 1865, a well was drilled at the Dodson mill site, after a Mr. Hadley fraudulently added oil to springs in what became the park. Hadley, who had hoped that investors would think petroleum was present, got the Wheeler & Wilson sewing machine company to invest $40,000 ($650,000 in 2019) in his scheme. In the next two years they drilled two wells, one 2,100 feet (640 m) deep at the former Dodson sawmill at Lake Rose and the other 1,900 feet (580 m) deep near the Ricketts mansion. No oil was ever found, and Hadley eventually fled to Canada.

Input: Passage: On 21 January 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twenty-five-year-old daughter of a dyer from Dresden. The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820.  Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on Rügen—painted after his honeymoon—display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that "the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art."Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friend's paintings "please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind."Friedrich was acquainted with Philipp Otto Runge, another leading German painter of the Romantic period. He was also a friend of Georg Friedrich Kersting, and painted him at work in his unadorned studio, and of the Norwegian painter Johan Christian Clausen Dahl (1788–1857). Dahl was close to Friedrich during the artist's final years, and he expressed dismay that to the art-buying public, Friedrich's pictures were only "curiosities". While the poet Zhukovsky appreciated Friedrich's psychological themes, Dahl praised the descriptive quality of Friedrich's landscapes, commenting that "artists and connoisseurs saw in Friedrich's art only a kind of mystic, because they themselves were only looking out for the mystic... They did not see Friedrich's faithful and conscientious study of nature in everything he represented".During this period Friedrich frequently sketched memorial monuments and sculptures for mausoleums, reflecting his obsession with death and the afterlife; he even created designs for some of the funerary art in Dresden's cemeteries. Some of these works were lost in the fire that destroyed Munich's Glass Palace (1931) and later in the 1945 bombing of Dresden. 
Question: What is the full name of the person who expressed dismay that to the art-buying public, Friedrich's pictures were only "curiosities"?

Input: Passage: Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky attended classes in music theory organized by the Russian Musical Society and taught by Nikolai Zaremba. A year later he followed Zaremba to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Tchaikovsky would not give up his Ministry post "until I am quite certain that I am destined to be a musician rather than a civil servant." From 1862 to 1865 he studied harmony, counterpoint and fugue with Zaremba, while Rubinstein taught him instrumentation and composition. In 1863 he abandoned his civil service career and studied music full-time, graduating in December 1865. 
Question: What is the first name of the person who questioned Kündinger about a music career for his son?
Response list: ['Ilya Tchaikovsky.']

Input: Passage: Terri Griffith is an aspiring teenage journalist in Phoenix who feels that her teachers don't take her articles seriously because of her good looks. After failing to get her dream job as a newspaper intern, she comes to the conclusion that it is because she is a girl.
With her parents out of town on a two-week Caribbean vacation, Terri decides to remedy the situation. Enrolling at a rival high school, she enlists the help of her little brother, Buddy, and her best friend Denise to disguise herself as a boy. Along the way she meets Rick Morehouse, a nerd who becomes her pet project. After helping him through an image makeover and encouraging him to start talking to girls, Terri starts to fall for him.
After many episodes in and out of school, including fending off a group of bullies led by bodybuilder Greg Tolan, dealing with her real college boyfriend Kevin and being set up on a blind date with a potential new girlfriend named Sandy, Terri manages to be accepted as "one of the guys". However, she is stunned when she turns in an article and her teacher still criticizes her work, making Terri realize her gender and looks were never the issue.
At the senior prom, a jealous Greg picks a fight with Rick, who ultimately trounces the bully in front of the entire class. When Terri's boyfriend shows up unexpectedly and discovers the ruse, Rick assumes that Terri's big secret was that she was gay. To prove otherwise, Terri opens her shirt and reveals her breasts to Rick. Although she admits to loving him, Rick rejects her, prompting a desperate Terri to kiss him in front of everyone. To placate the awestruck students, Rick derisively announces that Terri "has tits" before leaving the prom and Terri behind.
Heartbroken and humiliated, Terri retreats to her room and writes a long article on what it is like to be a girl in boy's clothing, detailing all of her experiences, both good and bad.

Input: Passage: Jess Wade, a former member of a gang of outlaws led by Vince Hackett, was led to believe that an old flame, Tracy Winters, wanted to meet him in a seedy Mexican saloon.  Jess saw Billy Roy Hackett, Vince's younger brother, summoning Vince and the other members of the gang into the saloon, and realized he was being set up.  Jess ordered the bar patrons to leave before a shootout ensued.  Making a break for the door, Jess was stopped by Gunner, another gang member, and was forced to relinquish his gun and to go with them to their hideout in the mountains.  Vince later told him that the gang had stolen a gold-plated cannon that was used by Emperor Maximilian in his ill-fated fight against popular Mexican leader Benito Juarez.  Vince informed him that, according to a wanted poster, Jess was in the gang who stole the cannon and had sustained a neck wound as a result of being shot by one of the guards.
Ordering his men to subdue Jess on the ground, Vince used a branding iron to burn his neck.  They took his horse, leaving him stranded.  He captured a wild horse in the desert and saddle-broke it.  The gang's motive was to force a ransom from the town they stole the cannon from, but the gang also used the cannon to hold the townspeople at bay.  Only Wade can save the people from his former gang.

Input: Passage: Darren Silverman, Wayne LeFessier, and J.D. McNugent, best friends since fifth grade and Neil Diamond fans throughout, form a Neil Diamond tribute band called "Diamonds in the Rough". Darren meets a beautiful but domineering psychologist who is showing signs of being emotionally abusive, Judith Fessbeggler, through a chance encounter in a local bar after a band gig. Six weeks into their relationship, Darren asks Judith if whether they could finally have sex, but Judith refuses in the belief that premarital sex is wrong; rather, she suggests non-penetrative sex as alternative, during which Darren gets nothing but a sore jaw.
Judith isolates Darren from his friends, demands that Darren quit the band, receive humiliating medical procedures, and attend relationship counseling under her care. Wayne and J.D. decide to save Darren from her by attempting to bribe her, arm wrestle her, and shock her with faked photographs of Darren cheating, all to no avail.
The friends, undaunted, try to reunite Darren with his "one and only", Sandy Perkus, when she returns to Seattle to take her final vows as a nun. When Darren and Judith announce their engagement, Wayne and J.D. kidnap Judith. However, Judith eventually discovers the identity of her captors, and the duo are convinced they cannot let her go. When they visit Coach Norton in jail (who accidentally killed a referee in a fit of rage) his advice is that they should just kill her. The pair attempt to shoot Judith, but end up deciding against it. Sandy's feelings for Darren are reawakened, but the pair's attempted date is ruined by Darren's preoccupation with Judith. Sandy, disheartened, returns to the convent, but Darren snaps out of it and runs the 30 miles there to win her back.

Input: Passage: The film begins with Thomas "Boats" Gilhooley ("boats" is a nickname for a bosun's mate) (Lee Marvin), an expatriate United States Navy veteran, working aboard a freighter. When he realizes that the ship is passing by Haleakaloha, French Polynesia, but not actually calling there, he jumps ship to swim to the island.
Next, Michael "Guns" Donovan ("guns" is a Navy nickname for a gunner's mate), another expatriate U.S. Navy veteran and a former shipmate of Gilhooley, returns from a fishing trip aboard an outrigger canoe. Donovan is greeted by William "Doc" Dedham, also a U.S. Navy veteran and the only physician in the archipelago, who is about to begin a one or two week pre-Christmas circuit of the "outer islands," taking care of the health needs of the residents. Dedham's three children are placed in Donovan's care.
The kids' plans for a peaceful celebration of Donovan's birthday on December 7 are shattered by the arrival of Gilhooley, who shares his birthday. There is an unbroken 21-year tradition that Donovan and Gilhooley have a knock-down, drag-out fight every birthday—-to the delight of the local observers-—and their 22nd year does not break the tradition. The two vets meet in (and trash) "Donovan's Reef," the saloon owned by Donovan.
Miss Amelia Dedham is a "proper" young lady "of means" from Boston, who has become the chairman of the board of the Dedham Shipping Company. Her father is Doc Dedham, whom she has never met, but who now has inherited a large block of stock in the family company, making him the majority stockholder. She travels to Haleakaloha in hope of finding proof that Doc has violated an outdated (but still in effect) morality clause in the will which would keep him from inheriting the stock and thus enable her to retain control.

Input: Passage: On 18 February 1914 The Rite received its first concert performance (the music without the ballet), in St Petersburg under Serge Koussevitzky. On 5 April that year, Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of The Rite as a concert work, at the Casino de Paris. After the performance, again under Monteux, the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers. The Rite had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921, at the Queen's Hall in London under Eugene Goossens. Its American premiere occurred on 3 March 1922, when  Stokowski included it in a Philadelphia Orchestra programme. Goossens was also responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946 at the Sydney Town Hall, as guest conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he brought it to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that "thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras ... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as "the most important piece of music of the 20th century".In 1963, 50 years after the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, a close friend of the composer, Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being "murdered by that frightful butcher". Instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening's performance of Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro, at Covent Garden. Under pressure from his friends, Stravinsky was persuaded to leave the opera after the first act. He arrived at the Albert Hall just as the performance of The Rite was ending; composer and conductor shared a warm embrace in front of the unaware, wildly cheering audience. Monteux's biographer John Canarina provides a different slant on this occasion, recording that by the end of the evening Stravinsky had asserted that "Monteux, almost alone among conductors, never cheapened Rite or looked for his own glory in it, and he continued to play it all his life with the greatest fidelity".

Input: Passage: Critical analysis of Beiderbecke's work during his lifetime was sparse. Surprisingly, his innovative playing initially received greater attention and appreciation among European critics than those in the country of his birth. The British music trade magazine "Melody Maker" published a number of reviews of his recordings and assessments of his cornet playing. In the April 1927 issue, bandleader Fred Elizalde stated: "Bix Bidlebeck (sic) is considered by Red Nichols himself and every other trumpet player in the States, for that matter, as the greatest trumpet player of all time". The magazine's editor, Edgar Jackson, was equally fulsome in his praise: "Bix has a heart as big as your head, which shines through his playing with the warmth of the sun's rays" (September 1927 issue); "The next sixteen bars are a trumpet solo by Bix, and if this doesn't get you right in the heart, you'd better see a vet…."
In Blackboard Jungle, a 1955 film starring Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Beiderbecke's music is briefly featured, but as a symbol of cultural conservatism in a nation on the cusp of the rock and roll revolution.
Brendan Wolfe, the author of Finding Bix, spoke of Beiderbecke's lasting influence on Davenport, Iowa: "His name and face are still a huge part of the city's identity. There's an annual Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival, and a Bix 7 road race with tens of thousands of runners, Bix T-shirts, bumper stickers, bobble-head dolls, the whole works." In 1971, on the 40th anniversary of Beiderbecke's death, the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival was founded in Davenport, Iowa, to honor the musician.  In 1974, Sudhalter and Evans published their biography, Bix: Man and Legend, which was nominated for a National Book Award. In 1977, the Beiderbecke childhood home at 1934 Grand Avenue in Davenport was added to the National Register of Historic Places."Bix: 'Ain't None of Them Play Like Him Yet", a 1981 film documentary on Beiderbecke's life directed and produced by Brigitte Berman, featured interviews with Hoagy Carmichael, Bill Challis and others, who knew and worked with Bix.

Input: Passage: Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.
By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her "one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor.
Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as "a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea. When the painting was put up for sale in 2012, the auction house catalogue stated that it had been owned by William Ride, former director of the Western Australian Museum. It reported:The current owners assert that Professor Ride always understood the figures in the picture were Sir John Winthrop Hackett, (then owner of The West Australian newspaper, well known business man and philanthropist, whose gift allowed the construction of the impressive University of Western Australia buildings and St. George's Residential College) and his new wife, Deborah Vernon Hackett".

Input: Passage: A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film.
Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies.
The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting "the factory" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket. 
Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good. Thus Mr Martin wins his battle of the sexes. 
Question: What is the road named where Martin's firm is located?
Response list: ['George Street.']
Ground truth: George Street.

Input: Passage: In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be "seriously jeopardized financially" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony "rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not wished to go on the tour because flying hurt his ears, and long land journeys hurt his back. The Soviet authorities threatened to cancel the tour if he did not lead it, and he felt obliged to go. The LPO gave nine concerts in Moscow and four in Leningrad.  Boult's assistant conductors were Anatole Fistoulari and George Hurst. Boult's four Moscow programmes included Vaughan Williams's Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, Holst's The Planets, Walton's Violin Concerto (with Alfredo Campoli as soloist), and Schubert's Great C major Symphony. While in Moscow, Boult and his wife visited the Bolshoi Opera and were guests at the composer Dmitri Shostakovich's 50th birthday party.After the Russian tour, Boult told the LPO that he wished to step down from the principal conductorship. He continued to be the orchestra's main conductor until his successor William Steinberg took up the post in 1959.  After the sudden resignation of Andrzej Panufnik from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO), Boult returned as principal conductor of the CBSO for the 1959–60 season. That was his last chief conductorship, though he remained closely associated with the LPO as its president and a guest conductor until his retirement. 
Question: What is the name of the orchestra to whose funds Bould always contributed his share of the recording fees?
Response list: ['LPO.']
Ground truth: LPO.

Input: Passage: With lessons learned from the Sanderson series, Longacre proposed to issue his own set of biographies illustrated with plates of the subjects.  He was on the point of launching this project, having invested $1,000 of his own money (equal to $25,097 today) in preparation, when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series.  In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery (later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who traveled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life.  He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president James Madison, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits.  Among these advocates was the former vice president, South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In July 1832, Niles' Register described a Longacre engraving, "one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art".Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827; between 1828, when their daughter Sarah was born, and 1840, they had three boys and two girls.  Sales of the Gallery lagged due to the Panic of 1837; Longacre was forced to declare bankruptcy and travel through the southern and midwestern states, peddling his books from town to town, with his wife and elder daughter managing shipping and finances at home.  Later in 1837, he was able to return to Philadelphia and open a banknote engraving firm with partners, Toppan, Draper, Longacre & Co.  With great demand for engraving for notes being issued by state banks, the firm prospered, and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at 1 Wall Street in New York.  According to Snow, Longacre was known as the best engraver in the country. 
Question: Was is the first name of the person Longacre wrote to in October 1831?
Response list: ['James Herring.']
Ground truth: James.

This has the secondary benefit of allowing us to put on some theater about how the other broke their word to win sympathy points. I also believe that Germany often wants A Munich to stay put anyways, to guard against an attack through Tyrolia.\n\nLet me also know your thoughts regarding Belgium. I am not super attached to claiming it, so would be open to bargain my support on the Belgian question for a future alliance.\n\nBest of luck to you!', 'Hi France!

Input: ['Hey there neighbor', 'Thoughts on how we want to split the Balkans?', 'Hello there yourself', "what are your thoughts?  I haven't spoken to anyone else yet so. I am open to ideas before that.  We would most certainly need to deal with Russia sooner rather than later", "Agreed -- I'd rather deal with Russia from the get go as well. Have you heard anything from Italy tho? I'm kind of worried of committing north if they're an unknown quantity"]
Response list: ['I think we should deal with Russia first, then deal with Italy.']
Ground truth: All I have heard from Italy thus far is they don't want to fight so... hopefully that is the case

Input: ['Hi there! I figured it would be good to open up talks between us, what’re your initial thoughts? I plan on playing rather conservatively until I see how some alliances are shaking out.', "Same on my end to be honest; first game I've ever played with any money on the line lol", "hm, if you're okay starting conservatively, could I make the ask that you start by opening to Tyn or move to take Tun with a fleet?", 'I’d still plan on moving into ION, it gives me more options.', 'Yea, I have no issue with Ion in and of itself ~~ id just rather not see you also setting up a Lepanto by prepping a convoy to Tun :p']
Response list: ["Okay, I'm going to go with Lepanto for now. I'm going to take Tun and then move to ION."]
Ground truth: If you reeeally want to try a Lepanto, we can go for it lol, but I think we'd stall out a bit too much to make it worthwhile

Input: ['Hi there! I think us attacking each other early game is pretty dumb, what’re your thoughts?', "I agree. Even with the element of surprise, it's just too easy to defend the Piedmont/Marseilles corridor.\n\nIf France attacks Italy, it will most likely be Austria who benefits, and likewise if Italy attacks France the spoils probably go to Germany.\n\nGiven that, what are your plans? Are you planning to attack Austria early, or thinking of the standard move of: \nF Naples - Ionian\nA Rome - Naples\nA Venice H", 'Yeah I’m not planning on going for Austria off the bat, I feel like it usually just locks the two weakest countries into a fight that hurts us both', 'Understood, good to know!', 'Seems like everything went pretty much according to plan. Not sure why Turkey stayed in Smy instead of backfilling to Con. Seems a bit passive to me.']
Response list: ["I think I'm going to go for the standard move of Naples - Rome - Venice"]
Ground truth: He’s scared of me pulling off a lepanto. What’s the deal for you guys, seems like you and england have an agreement at the very least to stay out of ENG. Did you and germany agree to that bounce in Bur?

Input: ['Hey France 😁. I would like to suggest an alliance between the two of us, against Germany. In my opinion a England-France alliance is super powerful, especially if we can trust each other. Germany has reached out to me about an alliance to attack you, but franly I think France as a country is a much more powerful ally.To start I suggest we have the English Channel as a DMZ and coordinate and attack on Germany. Anyways good luck and have fun!', "Dear England,\nI completely agree that the French-English alliance can be quite powerful. Naturally, the main sticking point early on is whether we can trust each other to demilitarize the Channel.\nOn my end, I have little reason to go there unless I distrust you. I plan to go to Mid-Atlantic, which would allow me to move to Spain (south coast) and establish an early presence in the Mediterranean. Will also aim to get into Burgundy, where I can potentially support you into Belgium.\nMy suggestion is that you open with:\nF Edinburgh - Norwegian Sea\nF London - North Sea \nA Liverpool - Yorkshire\nThis guarrenteed you a build in Norway even if Russia moves A Moscow north, while potentially letting you convoy into Belgium. And you can be safe in the knowledge that either A Yorkshire or F North Sea can cover London in the event that I don't keep my word.\nLet me know your thoughts. Good luck to you as well!", 'Sounds good!', 'How are your relations with Germany?', 'Getting into burgundy would be great. I’ll work some magic with Germany and try to get them to not move there.']
Response list: ['I think I’ll go with the English Channel as a DMZ and coordinate with you.']
Ground truth: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

I think I meant France or Austria?']
Response list: ['I think I meant Austria or France.']
Ground truth: Am currently speaking to both but haven't really moved towards either as of yet.

What are your plans vis a vis alliances and expansion?

Input: ["Good evening. I think it's important that we get our affairs in order regarding Sweden; I'm sure you know that you can easily bounce me to keep me out, but I'd like to convince you otherwise. Let me know if there's anything specific you'd like in return, otherwise I think that assistance against possible English attack and an agreement to leave Warsaw, Silesia, and Prussia alone is good.", 'Hi Russia! Thanks for reaching out. I’m open to an arrangement similar to those terms (neutrality in Pru, Sil, War, Boh if that comes up, as well as and really especially potential assistance against England). I would also like your support into Nwy down the road. I think splitting Scandinavia is reasonable and that takes pressure off of me to look to War as a future build. How does that sound to you? Looking forward to a fun and exciting game!', "I'd prefer for us to cooperate to take the British down completely; I get Norway, you get as many British home territories as you can convince the French to let you have. Aside from that, those neutral zones sound good to me.", 'I’m not sure I’m ready to just hand over Norway and Sweden, unfortunately:/', "You'll get Norway then."]
Response list: ["I think that's a good move."]
Ground truth: Sounds good to me! Thank you so much for being agreeable. I view Norway as a gesture of goodwill and I will definitely remember it. Hopefully, I will find another way to help you in the future 😃

Input: ["Greetings, Russia!\n\nWe don't have too much to discuss early on, but I was curious on whether or not you were planning to move A Moscow - St Petersburg, where you could make a play for Norway.\n\nAnd likewise, was curious whether you planned to order F Sevestapol - Black Sea, or else allow Turkey to occupy it.\n\nIt's early, but we might have room to cooperate against England or Germany in the future. Let's keep in touch. Good luck.", "I'd be very interested in organizing a group effort against Britain right now. I likely won't move to Saint Petersburg the first turn in case the Germans try something but I'm definitely bouncing in the Black sea.", "Understood, what's your plan then? \n\nYou might consider Moscow to Livonia, which would still improve your situation in the north (since you could convoy to Sweden and then build in StP), while also helping to cover Warsaw.\n\nOr else you could just commit both of your armies to the south.", "I've spoken with the Germans, and a group effort against the British is likely. I'm still considering various ways to secure my position better, but I think keeping one army put in Moscow offers the best stability for the time being; If the Germans are telling the truth it will likely move to secure a spot in Finland in the second year.", "I would advise against staying put. Both Ukraine and Livonia can defend 3/4 of your centers. St Petersburg  can't be attacked year 1 and the risk to Sevestapol is nominal in year 1, since even if he goes all out you bounce him out of Black Sea and he can only make an unsupported attempt from Armenia"]
Response list: ["I'm going to move to St Petersburg and then move to Black Sea. I'm going to move to Sevestapol and then move to Black Sea."]
Ground truth: Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North

Input: ['Hey Italy, just saying high. I doubt we will cross paths until later in the game, but if you feel so inclined you could attack France 😉. France is probably the strongest county and I think me, you, and Germany should shut them down before they can get up and running. Anyways, good luck and have fun!', 'Thanks for reaching out! Yeah as Italy I will have to feel the board out before making any commitments.', 'Of course', 'Things are looking pretty peaceful in the west!', 'I would have thought France would have gone army in Bre and fleet in Mar, do you know why he flipped them?']
Response list: ['I think I know why France flipped them. I think he was trying to get us to go to the north and then to the south.']
Ground truth: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you

Instruction: In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text. Your task is to generate a short summary for this text. The summary must include a situation which caused humor. The summary should be one or two sentences long.
Input: Text: i also have skype log with the friend who i mention in this post and if people are interested i will share it.

ok around 2 years ago the night before my high school graduation i couldn't sleep because i was full of adrenaline. my friend who is insomniac who lives in california was talking to me. now at the time i was really really really tired so i started acting like i was high. or at least what i think it's like to be high. i'm talking to my friend and i look outside my window and i see bunnies. i don't know why but these bunnies are so fascinating to me and i seriously want to share this with my friend. i told him all about it and i tried to get a picture of the bunnies but i couldnt. so then i got the bright idea of going outside at about 6 o'clock in the morning and trying to take a picture of these bunnies. so i'm finally outside and i can't find the bunnies because they're hiding in the bush or some shit. i'm pretty bummed out but then i turn around and realize that i locked myself out of my house. normally this wouldn't be a problem because i would have people at home and i would just call them but my mom was in italy so no one was at home. my aunt would come around during the day to make sure everything was okay but she wasn't staying with me at night. now here's the part that really sucks. the day before we had graduation rehearsal. the principal told us that we need to bring certain papers with us or we wouldn't be able to graduate. and guess what? my papers were inside the house. i was going to have to redo my senior year if i couldnt get inside.  because i wanted to take pictures of fucking bunnies for my friend on the internet. i tell my friend (i still have wifi) and he's literally unable to type to me because he's laughing so hard. i have no fucking idea what to do. my friend tells me i should break a window. i have nothing to break a window with. i guess i could push it but then i would probably get pretty fucked up and wouldnt be able to go to my graduation. also my mom would probably get pretty mad at me. so then i decide ok i have no choice. i'm breaking into my god damn neighbors house. i remember that when i was a kid my mom gave my neighbor a key to my house. i walk over to my neighbors house and thank god the door was fucking unlocked. i remember where the key was when i was a kid and i take it. i go back to my house. it doesn't work.  at this point i'm actually crying and i'm so mad that i can barely keep it together. i'm really over tired and my mental state is fucking terrible. i remember seeing one more key near the key that i took. i decided that it's worth a shot and i go back and get the key. and praise the fucking sun of actually worked. to this day whenever i see those bunnies in my yard i am incredibly scared and anxious.
Response list: ["i broke into my neighbor's house to take pictures of bunnies and now i'm scared of them."]
Ground truth: saw bunnies outside at six in the morning. wanted to take a picture for my friend. locked myself out of the house. didn't have a key. mom was in italy. stole key from neighbors house. almost missed graduation.

Instruction: In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text. Your task is to generate a short summary for this text. The summary must include a situation which caused humor. The summary should be one or two sentences long.
Input: Text: it happened last year. i was 29. never, until that day, had i broken a bone in my body. i was pretty proud of that; but pride comes before destruction.

my wifey had arranged a surprise trip up to visit a college friend and his family. we'd studied together during my exchange year in the us, and we became great friends. we've since had kids, got jobs; you know - done life.

things didn't start off great as, on the morning we left, my oldest (2 at the time) wasn't feeling great. we thought nothing of it. nothing of the fact that we had been hanging around with one of his mates who was pretty sick the day before. that turned into what we now affectionately refer to as the plague. the plague that got my other kiddo, their three kids, and one of them, violently sick. but that's another story for another time.

my friend and i wanted to go to the local park and visit his nearest pokèstop. who wouldn't?

we had a fixed gear bike and a skateboard between us - he'd left his longboard at work, and while i was really looking forward to using it, i figured we'd switch out and take turns on these other modes of transportation.

it's here that i'll say that a skateboard, to me, was only ever a means of transportation. my best mate and his brother loved going down to the park or cruising through town looking for ledges and steps. not me. i always wanted a longboard, but a skateboard did the job. a to b. home to college, college to town, etc. as long as it was flat, i was happy.
i'll also mention that using someone else's skateboard is rather like borrowing their car. sure, you know the fundamentals - how to direct it, slow it, generally maneuver it - but it will always feel... off... not quite your own. not quite comfortable. their trucks will be tighter, their bearings faster; the deck will be curved a little more, and the wheels a bit harder. so many things to fight against.

we set off one the first day with no problem. i rode the bike, he held the seat. three blocks there, three back. easy!

the second day, i rode there again. we decided that i'd ride the skateboard back and he'd cycle. bad decision number 1.

a block and a half down, we were making some pretty good speed. i was loving the feeling of pavement under my wheels again! but as we hit a new stretch of asphalt, i bumped and tensed up a little. major speed wobble. my stomach knotted.
i let go of the bike and ran the board down. no incident. ... so i got back on. bad decision number 2.

we set off again and built up some more speed. his house was just on the other side of the apex of a small hill, so as we approached, i saw that there was a little downhill stint before his driveway. we had some fair speed, so i didn't want to hit that hill - i mean, speed wobble going down that would be terrible!
again, the bike was a fixed gear, so all i needed to do was hold on until he had slowed down in his driveway, then i could dismount and we could carry on with the day. rent a movie, get some barbecue.

but no. i made bad decision number 3. i let go of the bike in order to avoid the hill.
with good speed, i carved to the side of the road to stop. i ride regular, so with my left foot planted firmly over the front trucks, i slid my right foot off the back and brought it forward to drag on the road and slow me down.
cue the most intense speed wobble of my life as i tense up on one foot, board going mental, headed towards a curb.

as i fall, i do what i did through high school rugby - tuck up, lead with the shoulder.

my knee hits first. tears a perfect square out of my favourite jeans. then my side, as i acquire an odd, uniformly rectangle-shaped road rash. my upper arm and shoulder hit with a crunch, the top of my head thuds down just shy of the curb.

i know something's up but there is no pain. none.

i rise to my feet and i mentally assess what's just gone on.

then i move my left arm forward at the shoulder. it "shlucks" forward way too easy. and pops back unnaturally. i do it two or three times.

"mate," i said, "i think this is dislocated."

i reach up with my right hand to feel a massive bump where my usually bumpless clavicle sits.

"oh, definitely broken," i almost chuckle.

what followed was a cocktail of ambulance rides, staying very still, sleeping very little, and working... not so much. i saw a doctor eight days after doing this and he said that if i didn't have the frame i did, it wouldn't have surprised him if the bone had split clean through my shoulder.
he scheduled me for surgery the next day. miraculously, it hadn't broken through the membrane around the bone itself, so all three pieces of my completely demolished collar bone were as cooperative as they could be for the strip of metal that my body now hosts.

my first broken bone. go big or go home, right?

i missed some work before the surgery, and a good few days afterwards. ate through my sick leave, personal days, and then some. cut two of my paycheques in half (and as the sole income for my family of four, that stung a little). missed enough work to disqualify me from my bonus. all the while i needed help getting dressed, needed to be driven everywhere, and couldn't hug my wifey or my boys.

i shouldn't have let go of that bike.
Response list: ['i let go of my bike, let go of my friend, let go of my life.']
Ground truth: got on skateboard well, got off it not so well. broke things. missed lots of work, family time and self-dependence.

Input: Text: i work in it and this all started a week or so ago by me backing up the archived company data. we have tons of archived data and i have spent weeks moving the files to external hard drives and removing the data from our main storage. finish most of the work and set the drives aside for the head guy to later take them home or what ever the company plans to do with the data. 

a couple of weeks go by and the company is determined to buy new storage but cheaply. they want to add space to alleviate the ever increasing amount by buying a home use data storage unit. cool, i guess, but not really a professional box. we have a little trouble getting it connected to the main network and the head man in charge comes down to help us as he working in that field for a long time. he asks why we did not fill up the box with hard drives like he asked and i replied that the box only needed two drives to start it up and we can add more as time went on. he tells me to add more drives and without really thinking i grabbed the backup drives and loaded them into the new box. one hour goes by and i realize what i had done. i pull the drives out of the unit and realize that all of the data had been formatted over. fuck. i tried using easus to get the data off but when i did nothing is really readable.
Response list: ["i backed up company data and added more drives to a new storage unit. i didn't realize the data was already formatted."]
Ground truth: i used archived drives to fill up a new storage box overwriting years of company data and costing thousands.

Input: Text: so about 5 years ago, my 12-year-old self and my family were driving back from a holiday in tasmania(large island below australian mainland) and stopped off at my cousins place halfway between tasmania and home.
we stayed there for a few days just to rest and catch up as we hadn't seen them for ages. on the last day before we left i had the ingenious idea of playing g hide and seek in their large backyard.
so the game had been going for quite a while when it was my brothers turn to count. i quickly decided that the best thing to do would be to climb a medium sized tree and hide within the branches. due to my plan being quite stupid my brother discovered me in around three seconds.
after that i was annoyed so as i jumped down from the tree (2-3 metres can't really remember) i didn't look where i would landed and ended up with my leg being sliced through by an ancient rusty star picket that someone had left below the tree.

at first i didn't realise and began to walk forward. i was confused as to why everyone had such strange looks on their faces and why they all rushed over. it was only then that i collapsed onto my face as my leg couldn't take my weight.

so it turned out that the pole and sliced right up through my leg leaving a massive, deep bloody gash that encompassed from my ankle to my knee.
the worst part was the my parents didn't even care so we got in our car and began the 10 hour drive home. well, they didn't care until it got infected that is.
Response list: ["my brother was playing hide and seek in my cousin's backyard and i was the one who got sliced through by a rusty star picket."]
Ground truth: when i was younger we went to stay at cousins house. we were playing a game when i jumped out of a tree onto an old rusty spike which went right up my leg, infecting it and leaving me with a huge scar to this day.

Input: Text: ok this happened 10 days ago when i ordered the ipad pro online, to be delivered by ups.  

last monday, i went to ups to pick up the package.  to my dismay, they declared the package was lost and asked me to contact apple.  

**day 1, 12/1**.  contacted apple cs.  they told me a replacement order will be sent to me, by 12/5 saturday (yesterday), because i need the ipad pro for a business trip.  the rep reassured me this will not be a problem, and that within 24 hours, i will get an email with the replacement order.  (so far so good)

**next day, 12/2.**  contacted apple cs chat again since no replacement order was sent.  the rep again assured me that it will happen in 24 hours, and then they can overnight the ipad pro to me by friday so that i can make my trip w/ it (ok....)

**12/3** got replacement order, but the delivery date shows 10 days from then, not overnight.  contacted cs because this will be long past my trip.  at this time, the ipad is finally in stock so i offered to pick it up in person.  i can finally get my ipad before the trip and happy holiday to me, right?  not according to apple cs rep:

"can you escalate the order so that i can get it overnight?" "nope"
"can someone from store overnight the ipad to me?" "our system doesn't talk to the store"
"ok, then can you change the replacement order to store pick up?" "our system doesn't talk to the store".  

wut!?  the customer tried to make it easy for the team by offering to drive 30 minutes to the store to pick up an item that's currently in stock, but you do not allow him to do so.  but wait, there's "one more thing".

according to the rep, the best solution is to cancel the replacement order and repurchase the item from the store.  

"ok.  but i ordered the item via a gift card.  will i get the refund fast enough so i can use the proceed immediately?  i need the ipad in 2 days you know?"
"yes the gift card will be there in 24 hours and the credit card portion will take 3-5 days to show up".
"ok then!"

**12/4.** replacement order cancelled, but still no gift card refund.  contacted cs and again he assured me i will get a new gift card email in 24 hours *(lies!)*

**12/5 (yesterday)** still no refund.  cs says it's in processed, and it will take 3-5 days. *(wut!?  after repeatedly promised that i will get the ipad by today for my business trip, the best answer i get is it's in process!?  if i knew i wouldn't have fucked up and cancel the replacement order in the first place!)*

**12/6 (just now)**:  called cs.  same answer, and bonus point they hanged up on me.  *(i think i have been blacklisted by apple.) *

obviously this has been a super frustrating experience.  the worse fuck up part of this is, apple doesn't have to fix any of these.  reality is no matter what the outcome, i would still buy the ipad pro, and that chances are when they release the ipad pro 2, 3, 4..., i will still buy them.  the situation is that fucked up!  

**ps:**  apple cs really sucks...maybe even worse than at&t's and comcast's.  at least a&t and comcast would be openly rude to you.  apple cs pretends to treat you nice and lies to you instead, so that they can get a favorable cs review.

Input: Text: so, this didn't happen today, it happened in december 2014.

my grandmother had passed away and we needed a burial plot to put her in. 
now, i'm from a tiny island, where there isn't a lot of space, so the plots in the ground are very expensive. most people put their dearly departed in these "coffin condos" and even those aren't cheap. i'm not sure what the term is, but they're these huge buildings made from concrete that go about 4 plots high and maybe 10 plots wide. if i find a picture of this i will post it in the comments.

so, as i said, there's not a lot of space and plots are expensive, so often families will have up to 3 of their deceased "share" a plot. this is possible when a lot of years go by between the deaths and the bodies have decomposed sufficiently, so the remains can be removed from their original coffin, be put into a much smaller box, so that then there is room for the new coffin. 

what they do is pretty gruesome if you think too much about it.
they open the plot, take out the coffin, open the coffin and "break down" the remains of the deceased into smaller "pieces" to fit in the smaller box and also clean up the plot for the new coffin.

now, when a plot of a deceased is opened to make room for a new coffin, it is mandatory that a family member be present to check that everything is in order. (i think the funeral home demands this to make sure that the family later can't accuse the funeral home employees of robbing the deceased's plot).

so, in this case that lucky family member was me. my grandmother had no close remaining relatives, my mother had died in march and had been my grandma's only remaining child, my dad was no help, so the care of the plots now fell to me. 

the plot my grandma was going into was that of her foster-father. this man died about 20 years before i was born, so it suffices to say that i didn't know the man. heck, i had never even seen a picture of him. still, i was the one that had to "supervise" his transfer to a smaller coffin.

so, there i was the day of the transfer and i was close to losing my shit. 2014 had not been good to me; my mom died in march, then my grandma died in december right before christmas and now here i was about to see my first skeleton. sure i'd seen dead bodies before, but never in that state of decomposition. i was pretty sure i was going to faint that day. my dad had come with me, but being the big hero he is, he was walking around somewhere between the plots and was no support to me. 

the cemetery caretakers show up and start opening the plot, all while i'm wondering when my nerves are going to get the best of me and i end up going night night. i look around where i'm standing to make sure that if i do faint, that there's some soft grass to land in. to my surprise i make it to the point where the coffin is taken out of the plot and the caretakers are waiting for my permission to open the casket.

i give the go ahead and there he is; my great-grandfather. it was like a skeleton wearing a pale blond wig and an old dusty blue suit. i could even see his dentures still sitting in what was left of his jaw. 

at this point curiosity is getting the best of me and i'm slowly inching my way closer and closer to the coffin trying to get a better look. i get up all to way to the coffin and take a closer look at what once was a living, breathing person. it was an odd experience to see what we end up as. 

as i'm dealing with all that i'm seeing, i take a deep breath and mutter to myself "ok.". 
apparently, i said "ok" a bit louder than i thought, cause the caretaker looks at me and says "ok?". i say "yes, ok.". to which then the caretaker again says "ok" and proceeds to yank off the skeleton's skulls and plops it into a small box on the ground. 
he then grabs the hand and begins cracking the fingers off piece by piece and also drops those in the small box.

from the background i hear my dad say "okay, we're gonna go now!"

Response list: ['i was about to see my first skeleton.']
Ground truth: went to watch an old relatives coffin get opened up so his remains could be put into a smaller box, to make room for my grandmas coffin. ended up watching a caretaker break down a skeleton piece by piece.

Input: Text: obligatory: this tifu happened 4 days ago not today.

my granddad called me around to do a few of diy jobs that he needed done. being the 'handyman' of the family, i tend to get these calls quite frequently. i got there and went through the first few jobs without a hitch. then he told me there was a problem with the light in the guest room. it had been working up until a couple of weeks ago, nothing had changed with the wiring but the light would no longer work even with a new bulb. half an hour of testing and troubleshooting ensues with a conclusion of a short on the wiring that runs through the loft.

i climb into the loft and try to find a route to where the wire goes through the ceiling to the light. the loft is definitely not designed well for negotiating your way around, very low clearance to the roof and insulation hiding the beams i need to stand on to avoid crashing through the ceiling. i find a possible path just past the water tank and start making my way.

**here is where the fu happens.** i try squeeze past the water tank but i brush the plastic bag holding the insulation around the tank. queue a sound like a waterfall and i panic. i back up to where i was and look at the tank, there is a crack in the tank which had obviously been spilling into the insulation bag for a while. my little nudge had been the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back and unleashed niagara falls in my grandparent's loft.

i climb out of the loft to find a bucket and notice water dripping down the wall. i walk over to it to see where it is coming from and,  as if sensing my presence, the water bursts through the wallpaper. i rush downstairs and there is water dripping out the ceiling in the kitchen. my grandparents are freaking out asking what is happening, i'm freaking out trying to figure out how i'm going to stop the water.

i find a large bucket and get it into the loft under the flow of water. i also manage to macgyver a partial fix by tying the tap that had caused the crack in the plastic tank into a position that slows the water flow substantially and the ball valve to stop the water inlet to the tank (old house and the inlet tap is impossible to turn). i had to bail out the remaining water in multiple trips just to ensure that there was no more leak damage.

now my grandparents have no heating or hot water while they wait for someone to come and put in a replacement tank. unfortunately my diy skills don't extend as far as plumbing in a new tank!

 

ps: sorry if the formatting is terrible, first ever post!
Response list: ["i tried to fix a leaky tank and it broke my grandparent's house down."]
Ground truth: went to fix an issue with a light, found out rats had chewed through the wire. went into the loft to fix the wire and released a deluge that had been trapped in the insulation surrounding a broken water tank. water broke through ceilings and walls and my grandparents are now without heating. oh, and the light still isn't fixed.

Input: Text: this actually happened today!

here's some background info: i work in a restaurant outside of the city limits, and i attend high school in town. it's a bit of a drive to get there... let the fu begin.

i was at work the day previous to the day previous of the fu (two days before the fu) and my boss asked me, "want to come in on wednesday?" (today) and i said, "sure." despite the fact that i had plans that day, and i knew it. i'm just afraid of disappointing my boss, and i had to find a way to cancel on him. i thought about it for two days. fast forward to the day of the fu. i'm just about to text him, "hey, super bogged down with homework today. won't be able to make it to work until friday" when i get a text from him, "just a reminder, the (name of restaurant) is in need of one [rhynofilms] tonight"
so i told him i'd be in at 5.
at 3, he texted me asking if i was still in town. for all intents and purposes, i was not. he needed me to pick up ground beef, but i said i would do that when i got to work. i get there, he gives me the business debit card, i take the highway into town. get the meat, and hop back on the highway. this highway, however, forks off into two highways. i was happily driving for 30 minutes before noticing that i didn't recognize any of the scenery around me. i was on the wrong highway for 30 minutes. as i continue driving, i read a sign that says, "now entering [city nowhere near mine]".
i'm now lost in an unfamiliar city, carrying raw meat and cucumbers, taking over an hour for a job that should take 30 minutes.  i placed a phone call to a navigator (my dad) and one to my boss (telling him that i took a wrong turn, and that i'd be there soon). i hopped back onto the highway, turned onto the correct one, and made it to work in record time. my boss, being the awesome guy that he is, asks me to explain myself in front of the new girl working there. i tell him, "well, good news. the weather in [that stupid city] is wonderful this time of year." he laughs, and pays for the gas that i burned, and for the hour that it took for me to get back. he says that the reason he paid me is because, "you were working. you were fucking up, but you were working." thus, leading me to post this here. i have the coolest boss in the world. that being said, because he was disappointed in me, i have to scrub the grease traps when i come in on friday.

edit: for clarification: yes, my boss was disappointed in me, but he didn't punish me monetarily. he has something else planned for me to make it up. i'll include the details when i'm not using a phone, but it is very unpleasant 

edit 2: added punishment for being an idiot
Response list: ["i was at work, boss asked me to come in on wednesday, i told him i'd be in town, i got a text from him, i took a wrong turn, got lost, called my dad, got back to work in 30 minutes, boss asked me to explain myself in front of the new girl working there. i told him i was working, he laughed, paid me gas, and i have the coolest boss in the world."]
Ground truth: i ran an errand for my boss, ended up in the wrong city. boss pays me anyway, but still embarrasses me in front of a new female co-worker. as punishment, i have to clean some real nasty grease traps

as i'm standing there watching my mate i reach for my waterbottle without looking. as i put it to my mouth i notice the plunger is a little bit stiff so i put it all the way in to my mouth to get a good grasp.

as i'm doing this i reach for phone on the side and notice a water bottle exactly like mine. this is when i look down and realize i'm snogging someone else's bottle. i put it back immediately and moved away, almost throwing up at the thought of it.

30 minutes later and no-one had picked it up. only as i was leaving did i see another guy pick up the bottle and squirt it into his mouth from a distance. grim.

Input: Text: alright so a little back-story so i don't sound like too much of a loser. 

i currently live 130 miles away from the town i grew up and since i only do online courses in school the only way i meet people is through work.

well it was my 21st birthday. i've drank many times before though, but hey your first trip to a liquor store legally is a fun experience. i normally drink whisky, vodka, rum, amaretto/ just all sorts of beer.

i live with three guys. they all work third shift (i used to as well, which is how i met them) and now i work day shift which makes things a bit lonely in my apartment. 

but anyway flash back to around 8 am on my birthday. one of my roommates forgot it was my birthday so he went to his room and past out, another had no idea when my birthday was so he went to his room and started playing diablo 3. the last guy however woke me up and we started getting ready to go to the liquor store. 

well we get there and in my mind... i've drank a lot of stuff... i drink mostly beer and whisky now because it makes me a lot less sick than my favorite drinks. (mike's and vodka) i know. i'm a white girl stuck in a guys' body. so anyway i wanted to try something new, i really wanted to get some mixed drinks like.. the stuff to make margaritas or something! my roommate would not stop hounding me about it how "gay" it was to get what i wanted. (btw we live in ky. it's bad enough that i play tennis and wear slim fit clothing, so if i drink anything "girly" i get branded as a homosexual because.. you know, rednecks and stuff.)

so i end up just getting a 6-pack of dos equis and red bridge. so i get home and it's probably about 1pm at this point, my other two roommates wake up and i reminded them it was national free comic book day. so we went to get some comics. got back at about 3:30pm.

roommate 1: the one that came with me to the liquor store is asleep

roommate 2: also asleep. 

roommate 3: pitty played some mk10 with me for about 30 mins just because he didn't want me to be alone on my birthday. 


time is now 4pm. i honestly planned on just chilling alone having my first legal drinks, but a bunch of guys at work had the idea of having a huge party at my place at about 10pm. well not of them where replying on fb and things were looking vague so i started drinking. 

at about 5:30pm i dragged a camping chair out in the parking lot, propped my feet up on my impala, and kept on drinking and reading comics in the sun. randomly out of nowhere a guy i used to work with on my 3rd shift job rolled up. i didn't even know he knew where i lived.

this guy is a creep, literally the definition of creep. he's like 28 and lives alone with his mom, no girlfriend because he creeps the hell out of them all. but he's an alright guy. he gets out of his car and i stand and wobble over to him beer in hand and ask "how's it going?" fast forward a few minutes we go inside and just start chatting. the chat lasts about an hour and a half and he get's up and goes "well, i guess i'm headed home. i didn't even know it was your birthday i was just trying to find out if i knew anybody buying the maypac fight for tonight" and he leaves.

i keep drinking and i never drank the same beer twice. i grabbed a different one each time and lined them up on how much i liked them. 

at this point i realize no one from work is going to show up, my roommates have to leave for work at 9:50 pm, and my new girlfriend had a lot of school work/finals to study for. but i had a salvation...

there was a pretty cool guy i knew that i got a job at my current place of employment that was probably still coming. i met him through his wife, who i used to get absolutely shit faced with all of the time. they were both supposed to come over, so hey. it'd be an alright birthday celebration after all. 

well it's about 9:30pm and i'm still just drinking and drinking. i had my astro a40's on listening to hollywood undead's new album just kind of rolling around feeling good. i randomly looked over at our front door and notice the top of what looked like a girl's head. considering she looked to be about 4 foot nothing it had to be the  girl that was coming with her husband. i open the door and she darts in holding a bunch of pizza boxes. "sorry (husbands name) can't come over tonight he's passing a kidney stone."

so she sits on the couch and starts drinking with me. my roommates leave for work and it's just us. i'm extremely bored as i'm about to tell her i'm getting way to sleepy to stay up and she suggests getting the weed out of her car. she knew i'd never smoked it before but was curious. so you know, being intoxicated impairs your decision making. so i say "fuck it".

we go in the half/bath and she prepares a "bowl" whateverthefuckthatis.jpg she smokes a small about and hands it to me and i light the thing and smoke it until there's nothing but black ashes in it. nothing.

she's like "ooooh gosh i'm already so fucked up omg im so high lulz"

so i smoked literally 4 more bowls withen about 4 minutes. still nothing. i was probably way to drunk to feel it. well i go to take one last hit before giving up and i inhaled way too fucking hard and it scorched the inside of my throat. i started violently coughing and dropped her glass pipe and it busts fucking everywhere also catching the rug on fire. i start stomping the flames to death while trying to keep my balance just screaming "fuck me! fuck me! fuck me!". once the flames were put out i realized this girl was sitting on the toilet so high that she didn't even realize what just happened. so i pick her up, sit her on the couch, and proceed to trip and crawl into my bedroom and pass out.

i woke up with the worst sore throat i've ever had and i still had no idea what being high feels like.
Response list: ['i got a lot of shit on my birthday and i got fucked up.']
Ground truth: i don't have any friends. i also dunno how to "marijuana"

Input: Text: obligatory disclaimer: this happened a couple of months ago. my friends encouraged me to post here about it and today i decided to. i know, i know...

so, a good friend of mine invited me to a cowboy themed drag show he was putting on as fund raiser for a pretty bad flood that happened in our area recently. i accepted and showed up on time but realized pretty quickly that "on time" is early and no one really shows up early anymore. should've known.

after the obligatory "hello's" and "how ya doin's" to my buddy and the other folks running the event, i found the bar and settled in. drink in hand, i began scoping out the few people that had trickled in since i arrived. i didn't really expect to find anyone i'd be into at this event but hey, i'd gone through a pretty bad break up a couple of weeks prior and was feeling desperate for some action. 

after chatting with the bartender for a while i finish my second drink. feeling a little loose, i turn around to check out the new arrivals when i notice an old friend of mine sitting alone at a table on her phone. 

i walk over, say hello and we begin to catch up. i hadn't seen angela (nope, not her real name) in about a year and find out she was in from out of town and meeting up with a few of the folks i planned on seeing this evening as well. score. we'd always had a mutual attraction to each other but never acted on it since i had always been in a relationship. obviously i'm thinking that shouldn't be a problem now.

the night progresses and we meet up with all our mutual friends. we drink. we dance. we have a blast. everything is going well and her and i are really hitting it off. 

once the show ends, someone suggests we go to another bar and as a group, we all agree. everyone is already quite drunk so inhibitions are pretty low. angela and i made out on our way to the bar and i'm feeling like a boss ass player. 

one or two bars later and we end up at an after hours dance club. it should be noted that angela and i pretty drunk at this point and i convinced myself that i'm some sort of amazing dance god. she's digging it even if i'm struggling to keep from falling down so i go in for the kill. 

"you wernt ta come over ter my place??"

i asked right before the beat dropped so i never actually heard what she said but it was something along the lines of, "sure. i guess."

fuck yes. i'm da best.

i call an uber and we start heading towards my apartment. she has us stop at a 7-11 to get her a toothbrush and i grab an ice cream sandwich. this night is going way better than i thought it would. 

we get home and our clothes start flying off. my buddy had given me a couple of viagra a while back so i pop one. i didn't want to get whiskey dick so it seemed like a good idea at the time. 

we start going at it and the viagra kicks in. my tony stark turns into iron man and for about 15 minutes, we have amazing sex. i feel like such a boss. 

she flips over and prepares herself to ride reverse cowgirl. i remember thinking, "hmmm. things seem a little dry down there." just before she slams down on the saddle. 

you know that moment when you're in so much unexpected pain that your brain doesn't even really register it? you know something bad just happened but you don't really feel it yet. that's about where i was in that moment. 

i shout in pain and push her off. i look down at my boy and blood is shooting out of the front. literally shooting out. the viagra and high alcohol content are pumping out blood like the fucking bellagio fountains. 

i run to the bathroom holding my junk and jump into the bath tub. she comes careening in after me shout-asking what the hell happened. i shout-tell her to shut up and take a deep breath before examining the damage. 

turns out, her forceful mount and lack of lube put an abnormal amount of stress on my bowstring (frenulum is the technical term) and popped the little guy right in half. 

so here i am, sitting naked in the shower, unwillingly rock hard, drunk and bleeding an impressive amount. she becomes hysterical, starts crying and calls her dad. 

why her dad? well, apparently he's a doctor. apparently she thinks he can give her some advice or home remedy to fix my broken bowstring at 4 am in the morning. yeah. i don't think so. 

you know what this guy says? "why are you talking to me? take him to the hospital." thanks angela's dad. real helpful.

after about 15 minutes, the bleeding slowed slightly but i'm starting to feel pretty woozy. the shock of the situation finally subsides and i begin laughing uncontrollably. i think, "this is what's happening to me right now. everything i've done in life has led up to me boner bleeding in the shower. this is what i have become." 

angela puts some clothes on and grabs the keys to my car. she tells me to get out of the shower and meet her out front to go to the er. i tell her she better yelp the best one because i'm not having some 4 star doctor handle my precious wounded hog. she's not very happy with me at that moment.

as i shamble out of the shower and gingerly put some clothes on, i look around for the nearest object to carry my broken junk in. maybe a smart person would grab a towel but nope, i grab a wide mouth mason jar that was sitting on the counter and tuck my dick and balls in that. why both? it was just more comfortable that way. 

the blood isn't coming out as much at this point but i still have an erection. pants pulled up to my thighs and holding the bloody mason jar between my legs, i walk outside and get in the car. 

we drive the 5 minutes to an urgent care (5 star rated on yelp, of course) and i walk in there with all my glory showing and no fucks to give. there's a few people in the waiting room but the guy behind the counter doesn't want me sitting in there with them because my pants aren't pulled up so i get the vip treatment and see the doctor right away. 

i explain the situation to dr. ted while nurse caroline takes my mason jar and throws it away (i mean, i didn't want it back i guess). ted is in his late 60's and and caroline isn't far behind in age. ted gets the thing clean and puts pressure on it when he drops the bad news. 

"op, the bleeding isn't really going to stop with out putting pressure on it. i don't want to stand here all night and hold your [glorious member] so we're gonna have to stitch it up." 

nope. 

i ask if there's anything else we can do. literally anything else. glue? bandaid? caroline puts pressure on it? no dice. 

in a last ditch effort, i ask for some sort of anesthetic but he explains that would be more painful than just getting the stitches. 

caroline holds my hand. i glare at angela. ted puts 3 stitches in. i cried. we all bonded. 

angela and i drove back to my place in silence. she left back to her hotel shortly after we got back. we haven't talked since then but i like to think the conversation with her dad the next day was very awkward. 

three days later i got the stitches out. ted and caroline weren't there so i had to explain the story to a whole new set of people. they laughed, a lot. i left them a 5 star review on yelp. 

 

edit: thanks for helping me get to the front page, all the kind words, and of course, the sweet sweet gold. i read all your comments and laughed a ton. my day has been made and i have a permanent smile on my face thanks to all of you.

Input: Text: so this actually happened today, unlike 95% of tifu posts. 

i was on my way to class to take a final (i take summer classes), my commute was going smoothly. i was about halfway there and still had 15 minutes to spare. now usually i'm a really aggressive driver but i thought to myself, "you know, i got time, i may as well just sit back and relax, enjoy my commute without driving like a dick."

here's where the fuck-up happens, i'm in a line of cars waiting for a light to turn green and there's a nun in a church van full of kids pulling out of the cvs directly to my right. me first thought was "zero chance i let this van in front of me". i second guessed myself, and thought "you know what this is a perfect opportunity to do my "good deed" for the day so i let her in. 

biggest mistake of my life. 

turns out she was driving to my school for only god knows what (no pun intended), so i follow her the entire way to my school. 19 mph in a 35. my less than 10 minute ride from that cvs, turned into 30. i showed up to my final 15 minutes late and my professor told me that i was not able to sit for the final because i was late. so in retrospect, i should've just said fuck the church van and continued driving like a dick.

Input: Text: i just moved to a new area and i was getting off the public transportation and somebody yelled at me, "do you go to [school redacted]?" i of course did not, but the kid then said i looked like somebody from there and began to talk with me.

he complemented my recent haircut and introduced himself. he then got to talking with me about my background and his own. i kept talking to this kid for some reason. he seemed fine – he was well dressed, had a good job and was heading to a meeting of his own school's alumni.

as he was leaving to go to his meeting, he asked for my number to text me about some business opportunity nearby. he vaguely called it, "big businesses." i wasn't thinking much or at all for that matter and gave him my number.

at this point, he had my number, my first and last name, the college i actually went to and my place of work. i looked the kid up and everything he said was true, he did go to that college, he was a member of his alumni club, he did have the good job he said he had, but it was still odd. he was vague about what his "opportunity" was.
i originally thought this kid would never contact me again, but then he called me tonight. i deflected, hung up and then blocked him from my phone or finding my facebook and linkedin. i don't know whether this question could lead to his finding who i am, so i'm posting this from a throwaway.

i think he was trying to recruit me for a mlm, but i was wondering whether he could do anything else against me with the information he has. i know i sound a bit crazy, but i will be honest – i am a bit afraid. i have (hopefully) learned my own lesson to not talk to people like that, but just wanted thoughts from other people on my idiocy.

my boss's office is in the 'inner perimeter' of the business, and customers are not supposed to get out of the front lobby. well somehow they did, and when we were out to lunch a prospective client somehow got past the lobby, into the back offices, and tried to 'ring' by boss but instead told the police there was a dangerous intruder. well we got back to see the client and his assistant in cuffs, in the lobby, being questioned by police. unfortunately they didn't have the same sense of humor as i did and they become not clients awfully quickly. fortunately, my boss was a funny guy and laughed it off and told me to find other clients to make up for it.

Input: Text: so, i'm a film major in college and as part of a final project, a friend and i rented out the school's studio to build a set for a shoot over this coming weekend. this required up to start painting flats and setting things up while not disrupting the set that was currently built inside the studio (he had it until thursday).

behind the set the other student had built, there were two spare triple flats (basically 2-12x8 ft. walls made of plywood/2x4's) leaned against each other, one had leg braces supporting it, but the other did not. we needed to take the one that had legs out back to paint it, which posed the question: what do we do with this other triple flat that can't stand on its own?

my friend set out to find the equipment room manager to lend his expertise, while i pondered how in the holy hell we were going to get this thing out of the tiny corner it found itself in, let alone get it out the door. he returned with not the equipment room manager, but instead another student. he said his office was locked and that he got the next best thing: a random dude he found in the hallway!

the three of us look at the task at hand for a moment, before the new guy says he has it figured out and starts un-clamping the legs. and as a human being with absolutely no foresight or questions for a man who seems to know what he’s doing, i followed his lead and detached the rest of the legs. once they were removed, our hero lord and savior tells me to grab the other end of flat #2 and the two of us will lift it and take it out of here while my friend supports the original one that never had any legs.

i should also mention that on the far right side of the flat, there is a giant glass window that weighs about 4 metric fucktons. guess which side of the wall i ended up grabbing.

once the two of us get it out and around the corner, this modern day saint tells me to put it down and he looks around for a moment before saying "i have no idea where we can put this," followed by promptly walking out and to look for the equipment room manager himself.

so, i'm holding up one huge, heavy, wall on one side of the room, and my friend is holding up an equally as huge and heavy wall on the other side of the room under the impression that help was on the way. because we couldn't actually see each other, i shouted across the room to let my friend know to just keep holding, it'll only be another minute or so.

20 minutes later, there is still no sign of the manager, or the good samaritan that got us into this pickle. at this point, we're both pissed, but we couldn’t physically place these flats down because there was no room and they’re too heavy for one guy to lift on their own. because the door was closed, there's no point in trying to yell out to someone to help through a soundproof studio. it's basically the first saw movie, minus the not-so dead guy in between us.

suddenly, i realize that i have not kept up on my daily hydration and start scanning he room for the water bottle i never should have put down to grab the flat in the first place. i spot it on the other end of the room, just outside of my friend's grasp.

i mention this to him, and because he's such a swell individual, he starts macgyvering a way to grab it and with the hopes of somehow hail mary-ing it to me. he is able to get his legs around one of the leg braces that used to do the job we inherited and uses it like a hockey stick for double amputees. he slap-shots it to me and i shit you not, it hits my foot dead on and stops faced up.

after a few moments of celebrating, i look down at the bottle and now realize the flaw in our plan. this whole time i had been keeping this thing balanced with both hands. "aw, fuck it" i said, "i can hold it with one arm for a second."

i could not.

as i leaned down for the bottle, i remember thinking, "ah, this is easy" then i looked back up at this massive chunk of wall starting to lean backwards. i immediately jump back up and put my hands out to force it back up, but physics weren't on my side. i ended up using both hands and my neck (dumb fucking idea) to try keeping it afloat, but gravity is a fickle cunt.

right in the flat's trajectory, there is a metal cart about 4 feet tall. remember that heavy glass window i mentioned? yeah, that slammed right into the corner of the cart.

because i was holding it, the glass wasn't entirely shattered, but it made a spider web crack through the bottom pane of glass.

my friend shouts out "what the hell was that?" and i, while still pinned under the flat like it's 127 hours, for some reason just shout back "i'm fixing it!" in that moment, i gathered the strength of a thousand men and slid the whole thing across the room, knocking over a few set pieces from the other guy's set and plopped the thing down flat on the ground with a loud thud.

"seriously, what the fuck happened?!" my friend shouts from his still standing flat. i emerge from the rubble with the water bottle in my hand. "i was thirsty. now i'm gonna go find <equip. manager>." and i storm out.

by this point, he was back in his office and the douchebag who left us in there to die never even told him anything was up. i explained the whole situation and he came to help with two other guys and together we got those two flats out of there. thankfully, we can make do without the window i smashed, so the entire shoot won’t suffer, but god damn, i just want to know where that random guy went. i also now realize that we easily could have just called someone to come help us out, but hey, hindsight’s 20-20.
Response list: ['i was holding up a huge wall, my friend was holding up another huge wall, and we were both pissed.']
Ground truth: holding up a tv flat. got thirsty. got water. dropped flat. broke a window.

Input: Text: tifu by talking too much.

before i get into my fu, i'm posting from my phone and apologize in advance for any formatting fails.

i'm an escort. aka prostitute, hooker, ho, whore, courtesan, etc. this happened yesterday.

i got a call 3 days ago from a gentleman we will call tommy. what made tommy vastly different from my other clients was that tommy is gay. he explained to me that he needed a female to accompany him to dinner at his parents house, and be very flirty/mildly affectionate towards him. from what i gathered, he seemed desperate to keep his sexual orientation a secret from his family. 

no problem! i would receive my regular rate plus a little extra to cover my gas and time to get to his apartment so we could arrive together, plus the promise of a nice tip for a very convincing show.

the town tommy lives is is about 2 towns over in the next county, and has an "adult superstore" that i have never visited. i decided to leave 2 hours early to give myself plenty of time to browse. i'm always on the lookout for new toys, lingerie, lubes, and the such to spice things up for clients.

i found a very intriguing product there among the usual fare called the "feeldoe". it's a totally different approach to a strap-on and it was something i thought would make my job much easier. i get many bookings for fetish sessions that include strap-on play, and those bastards are hard as hell to control. this product looked like exactly what i needed.

i proceeded to the checkout lane with my items, and upon getting there realized the girl in line ahead of me had the exact same feeldoe! i asked her if she had ever used one before and she said no, that her husband had read about it online and had sent her to find one. i commented on the price, and said that i could justify it in my head as work expenses. she asked what i did, and i told her i was an escort. she told me she had always been fascinated by that type of work, and asked me if i met a lot of sickos. i said no, most of the guys i meet are just very nice, lonely guys who have needs. a lot of them don't even want sex. i used tommy as an example. i explained he was gay, and would apparantly do anything to hide that fact from his family and had hired me to assist in the charade. i then joked that for what he was paying me, i should offer to use the feeldoe on him after dinner.

i pay, leave with my purchases and head to tommy's place. we head over to his parents place a bit early because he wanted his father to look at something to do with his car. 

we walk in the front door and his mom takes my coat, tommy introduces us, and says he needs to go explain this car thing to his dad and he will be right back. his mom says she and tommy's sister are just finishing up supper and asks if i would like to have a drink with them in the kitchen before dinner. of course! 

i follow her into the kitchen and she says, "hooker bloopers, this is tommy's sister kadence". omfg it's the woman i was speaking to in line at the adult store! i feel my face flush and i may have actually said fuck under my breath. she gave no indication we had ever met and exchanged nice to meet you etc. chit chat. 

the dinner went remarkably well and she didn't out either of us. i told his parents i was a massage therapist. they seemed to like me and invited me back. but the entire dinner, everytime i looked at her, i couldn't help but remember the remark about using the feeldoe on her brother.
Response list: ['i was an escort, i got a call from a guy i thought was a nice guy, i told him i was an escort, and he told me i was a massage therapist.']
Ground truth: i accidentally outed a client of mine to his sister while buying a strap on dildo and joking about using it on him.

Input: Text: i was at the mall with my friends because we wanted to see a movie but all of the movies were sold out. one of my friends suggested we try the free samples in the food court. first one we stop at is this chinese food place. all three of us take a sample and as we're getting ready to leave the woman giving them out stops me, pulls me over to the counter and forces me to buy food because we're not allowed to take the samples without buying anything. i cant understand a thing she is saying either because she is yelling, people are talking all around me, and she is very bad at speaking english. when the guy is giving me the food he didn't ask what i wanted just threw rice and chicken on my plate and charged me 15$. the guy at the register asked if i wanted a drink. after he explained to me that the 15$ i paid didn't cover the cost of a soda i politely declined his offer for a drink. at least he was honest. one of my friends left while i was dealing with this and as i sat down to eat the food i didn't really want i saw that he had the same food as me that he bought from the other chinese food place right next to the one i was at.... for 5$. the only reason i bought anything from there was because i didn't want them to call the cops and tell them i stole from them. food wasn't that bad though, just insanely overpriced!
Response list: ["i wanted to see a movie, took a free sample of chinese food, got pulled over by a guy who was giving me food and charging me 15$ for it. i didn't want to pay for a drink, so i declined. i saw that the guy had the same food as me, and i didn't want to steal from him."]

Input: Text: some background information: i've been single for 3 years now, and, well, haven't had sex since.

i work at a grocery store, and this past week i was being taught how to order. my supervisor (fairly attractive, mid 30s i'd say) was helping to expedite the process by working ahead of me, straightening products in the freezer doors. she got pulled away for a moment, and i caught up to where she had been working. when she came back, she picked up where she had left off by squeezing in front of me, bent over to finish the lower shelves. not a problem in itself, i'm tall, and was working on the upper shelves. however... when she squeezed past me, she brushed against my thigh. for whatever reason, i got immediately turned on and had a half chub. as i try to scan a product she decides to back up and backs right into my crotch and gets full contact with my semi-erection. needless to say, she hurried ahead, and made sure to move faster than i was.

note today i volunteered to help with an elementary 1k/5k fun run.  i helped direct the runners on certain areas of the track, they even have me a bright flag to look official!  as i am waiting on the race to start the nats begin attacking.  i know, i will use the flag and wave it around my head to keep them away.  about my third wave i flick the flag back and just like a wet towel it makes a loud **crack** , only it makes contact with my burnt, crispity, crackly forehead.  i feel like an idiot and i can't run my head due to the tight, burnt skin that feels as though it is on fire if you when look at it wrong......

Input: Text: that it was cherry cheesecake (my fucking favorite guilty pleasure) should have been a warning. hell, the post-it declaring it mine should have been the warning. it was left-handed handwriting and there’s only one lefty that lives here. 

god, i’m such an idiot. i know, i should have known it was too good to be true, but it was 3am and i was hungry—why would i pass up what was obviously the work of some good-spirited obesity elves? would *you*? anyway, i was so hungry that i, in my stupidity, did not recognize the cheesecake for what it was: a weapon. 

…maybe i should give you guys some background information here. **skip to the tl;dr, if you must, this will be a long, (and possibly a bit dark, i guess) read.**  

see, on any given day, my home has the potential to become a war zone and i like to say that all outcomes considered, i, a 22yof, have learned to cope with it pretty well. over the years, i learned to develop a way of living that would keep me sane without the use of drugs (besides sleeping pills), and maybe only a little bit of alcohol. this way of living isn’t cheap or easy, and to be honest, i’m surprised it’s gone on as long as it has without being interrupted. before today, that is. anyway, the rules are thus:

- if nothing else, do not accept his gifts
- buy your own groceries, mini-fridge, microwave, and/or hot plate so that you can cook your meals in your room and avoid stolen food mishaps
- have a source of entertainment in your room, be it books, a computer, a handheld gaming system or a tv with netflix to minimize contact with him in the outer rooms
- everything you own, buy yourself so that he can’t take it away/destroy it as ‘punishment’ or out of retaliation, and if he does, you can file a police report under destruction of property/robbery
- under no circumstances accept his gifts
- have a lock on your door, convince him that it was ‘his idea’ so that he won’t feel inclined to assert his authority and break it
- have some kind of income to pay for all this shit and make sure you’re also in school so that when you get home you can’t do anything but shower and hit your pillow
- under *no fucking circumstances* do you *accept his gifts* 
 
somehow, dear reddit, i managed to break my most important rule of all by eating that cheesecake. to put it simply, i fucked up. first of all, it wasn’t in my mini-fridge; i had no business looking in there in the first place. i was just so damn *hungry* and it was the middle of the night so i figured no one would notice and start an argument if something was missing. besides, it fucking had my name on it! it was practically begging me to eat it, for chrissake!

as you may already have guessed, it was a setup. my stepfather had gone and intentionally put that traitorous, creamy, son-of-a-bitch motherfucker in there. he’d put it in there knowing that i would be hungry and exercising of poor judgement after a long day and he knew that i would take one look at the cheesecake and my sleep-addled brain would mistake it for a godsend. he knew that i couldn't buy groceries this week, and he fucking did it on purpose.

see, my stepfather is a sociopath. and, like most high-functioning sociopaths, at first glance, anyone with eyes would say that he’s a hardworking, family-oriented type of guy—you know, your usual run-of-the-mill, morally upstanding breadwinner. sucks that his family doesn’t appreciate him, he tries so hard to be a good father. even refers to his stepdaughter as his own blood. wow, what a great guy. 

except, he’s not like that—not at all. he’s so good at acting like he is, though, that even if you gouged a hole in his carefully constructed facade with a jackhammer, you still wouldn’t get a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg (how’s that for metaphor?). he’s so good at it that, at times, i think he believes it himself. i say this because he’s gone to the er multiple times for “chest pain”, and each time it’s after he’s done something horrific enough to cause a few outsiders to look a little closer.

my sister believes it’s (the chest pain) from guilt. i’m on the fence on whether he is capable of feeling guilt. i think it’s more along the lines of, “i need the attention shifted away from the fact that i just pulled a move from wwe on my daughter—who is totally lying about that by the way, *she* attacked *me*, i was acting in *self defense*—to how pitiful and in pain i am. i might die from the strain on my heart, says the doctor, and no one would care. woe. woe is me.”

…i’m getting sidetracked again. the point is that i fucked up and ate the cheesecake. the cheesecake was so delicious that when i found out he’d put it there for me, i couldn’t imagine that he did it for an ulterior motive. i think my actual line of thought was, *how could something so good be used for evil?* and the sad thing was that already i was viewing him in a totally different light—i was feeling sorry for him and the fact that my mom was finally growing a pair and kicking him out. 

i found myself thinking that maybe she was just overreacting. i found myself thinking things like, "so what if he destroyed her phone because there was a text he didn't want her to read on it? people accidentally send texts to group chats all the time!" and,  "so what if he'd intended for it to go to another (married) woman? that lady is totally cool, we've known her for years--she'd never be inappropriate, even if it was at 4:30 in the morning!"

never did it cross my mind that i had unwittingly become ammunition in his fight to stay, even as i began to doubt that removing him from our home might be a solution to most, if not all of our problems. 

it is only now, as i sit here typing this and the cheesecake is undoubtedly congealing in my gut, do i realize how far under his thumb he has gotten all of us. it has been two weeks since my mother has told him to leave, and he is still fucking here. he even put all his things back into her closet. i can sense that my mother is slowly beginning to have doubts as well—i caught her eating a rocky road ice cream he left for her in the freezer this afternoon. needless to say i feel like i just swallowed a sack of bricks. 

i’m guessing he’s going to be here for a while longer.
Response list: ['i ate a cheesecake.']
Ground truth: i ate a slice of cheesecake and it (almost) fooled me into thinking step-dad was a good guy. he’s not. and he won’t leave.

Input: Text: ok, this tifu actually happened when i was in 7th grade, (im 20 now) but alas, i did not know what reddit was when i was in middle school. 


it was my seventh grade history class, and my great teacher happened to be sick that day, and was replaced with a morbidly mean substitute, who we will call ms c. ms c seemed like a happy person, but at second glance you would notice that she scoffs at any misbehavior, and has a low tolerance for annoying kids. 


me, being an annoying kid myself, tried my best to cause all kinds of mischief. i was the kind of kid who loved attention, and would go at great lengths to get myself in trouble just to make somebody laugh. but, knowing ms c, i knew i would have to fly a bit under the radar so i didn’t get myself screwed over and sent to the principal's office. thus, i would laugh and giggle with my friends quietly while class was starting, and she gave me an evil looking eye.


she stood up and spoke in her monotone voice, announcing that we will have to be participating in a longer worksheet than we normally do. me, being the obnoxious kid i was, decided to blurt out “i’d rather just kill myself instead….”, which made my other careless friends around me laugh.


but, ms. c did not laugh, she glared at me, and with a moment's pause, she screams “go to the nurse now!” me, being a seventh grader, was confused as all hell with my other classmates. i stood up and as she pushed me out the door, i thought to myself, why the nurse? is that worse than the principal? what the fuck would the nurse be able to do to me? so i decide to wander around the hallways, contemplating my fate. it is only after 5 minutes that the sub notices me and pushes me all the way to the nurse.


ms c makes me tell the nurse what i said, and i do. “it was just a joke,” i said, “it didn’t mean anything”, i explain afterwards. she, for some reason, nods her head in understanding, and tells me my guidance counselor will be there shortly. as a seventh grader, at this point i am freaking the fuck out, and i don’t really understand what i am supposed to do. 


i end up talking to the guidance counselor, who called my parents and told them i wanted to commit suicide. my parents also drove straight to the school while my mom teared up in fear. i had to explain everything to them, and they almost did not believe me because the school told them otherwise. on top of that, i was told i had to have weekly meetings with the guidance counselor while they tried to figure out what was wrong with me. eventually they realized i was just kidding, (fucking duh) and i got to stop having sessions with the guidance counselor. on top of all this, all the kids in my history class thought this was hilarious, and i was made fun of by my entire seventh grade class for the rest of the school year. just about almost everyday i was known as the kid who told our sub i wanted to kill myself. my friends still like to bring it up to me this day.
Response list: ['i told my sub i wanted to kill myself, and i was made fun of by my entire seventh grade class for the rest of the school year.']
Ground truth: i jokingly told a substitute teacher i wanted to kill myself instead of doing a homework assignment, and i was forced to talk to my nurse and have guidance counselor meetings until i was “fixed”. also, my whole grade got to make fun of me for the year.

Input: Text: this wasn't a terribly recent fuck up, however after someone doing a good deed for me encoraged me to pass the good fortune on by helping others

i was just about to move into a new house, a house that didn't have a fridge or freezer in it. being an older building standard sizes which were readily available weren't going to be suitable, so one had to be ordered and was going to take 6-8 weeks to be delivered. living without s fridge for up to 2 months was going to suck!

after hearing of my predicament a friend offered me her beer fridge from her garage. wonderful. problem solved, especially as it wasn't terribly large i could fit it in my relatively small car, and it would fit in the house. problem solved and my new chilly appliance worked flawlessly during the waiting period

once the new fridge freezer had arrived, the beer fridge was moved to the spare room before being returned to it's rightful owner, only she decided she didn't want it back as they hadn't missed it, and it just took up room. 

motivated by her kindness, i cleaned that fridge better than i'd ever cleaned any fridge before in my life, even plugged it back in and left a bunch of quartered lemons to make sure it smelled as fresh a mountain forest

once clean, i placed an advert on a freecycle website as available immediately and waited for replies to come in. within an hour i received an enquiry from a man who had lost his job end was really struggling to make ends meet, his fridge had quit on him and he didn't have the funds to replace it. the perfect candidate i thought, karma was going to be passed on and i was feeling pretty good. we arranged that the man would collect the fridge the next day and i went to bed with a warm glow

he arrived, checked out the fridge and was overjoyed with how clean it was, and what a relief that they could keep good cold again. the two of us struggled down the stairs with the fridge, at which point i saw his car for the first time, which was tiny, even smaller than my car. to make things worse, the trunk of his car didn't open and he thought it would just go in through the back door, which it clearly wouldn't. anyone with even a miniscule amount of spatial awareness would be able to tell this wasn't going in the back door unless it was crushed. he explained that he couldn't afford to get the lock fixed and they'd just learned to live with it.

not wanting to carry that freaking thing back up the stairs, i took it upon myself to go grab a screwdriver and climb into the trunk of his car and manually pop the lock open! problem solved, it would now fit in the car with the back seats down, although it would be kinda tight in his little hatchback. i showed him how to manually open the lock with said screwdriver while the trunk was open and he was overjoyed with this newly learned piece of information, not only had i just given him a fridge, i'd also showed him how to open his trunk!

i stood and watched him drive away, waving goodbye with a warm glow in my heart, which slowly faded as i realized that there was no way he could manually open the trunk because the entirety of the back seats and trunk was now taken up with the fridge.

i have visions of an power extension cord running from his house into the back of the car and him trotting out in his dressing gown to grab milk first thing in the morning

Input: Text: (to start off, this happened yesterday but i was to tired after this fu to do anything other than sleep)
so i am applying to a research this program this year, and the application was basically the equivalent of a college application and i was royally screwed because it was due monday i had done barely 1% of it. but by gods grace and the fact i live in nj, we had a snow day. taking advantage of the gift i spend the whole day working on this application. (note: i have a a really bad habit of never saving things, often times i'll just leave the window open and not save it). fastforward many hours to 8 p.m. i finally finished most of my application and there are only couple essays left which i left to do over the weekend. so like a complete dumbass i haven't saved but i was just sitting and gave a sigh of relief. here i was thinking i was finally done and could relax and enjoy the rest of my snowday. now my application was currently split into two, the small 1% i had done earlier and the majority of the app. so, in order to combine the two, i open a new doc and copy the majority of the app, after copying that part i close the window and click do not save changes. then all of a sudden my mom yells. distracted by her yelling i go ahead and copy the other 1%. after she fi sines i head to the new doc and paste. only the the small 1% pops up. confused i keep repeatedly pressing ctrl+v only the 1% pops up. where the fucking hell is the resr of my application?!?!. then it dawns on me. i just sit there wide eyed and slowly twitching. i frantically rush trying yo re-open words and... nothing, the one time i actually needed an auto-save file there's nothing there. i try googling everything searching for a answer. after an hour i had pretty much lost all hope, when there's a sudden glimpse of hope. i read that mac has a temp folder for documents like these. rushing, i open the folder, sure enough there are a some rtfs in there (rich text files) i start opening some up and sure enough there are some old documents i never saved. i proceed through the list and arrive at the the file that was edited today. holding my breath i open it, thinking it's my saving grace and.... gibberish. it's all character gibberish without a single english letter . all the other files were perfectly fine, but the one file i needed the most recent file was corrupt. i sit paralyzed and proceed to scream every curse known to mankind. i had to finish most of the app today otherwise i wouldn't be able to finish the essays over the weekend. so i open a fresh doc at 8 pm and start working once again. fast forward to 3 am and it's done. i sit there in the middle of the night holding this app like gollum in lotd going "my precious" so long story short in a supreme fu i wasted a perfectly good snow day.

 they're really high demanding on grades. now, i'm in the highest set for almost everything but they still seem dissapointed and overly demanding. i also get extremely high grades and they still seem dissapointed. sometimes they just ignore my existence. before anyone tells me its because they love me, i'm pretty sure its not. again this is mostly from my dad. i even said what would happen if i don't live with you and his reply was "no. i would disown you. you also have to give me all your salary". he always ridicules me. he always complains about me. he always compares me to his freind's sons who are a lot more older and expreinced and therefore a lot more academically acheived then me. i'm not even sure that sentence is plausable. sometimes it's just ridiculous. for example a few years ago, their was a 5 year old in bangladesh who was quite smart. he could spell words where at the time i could barely say. bare in mind that i'm really shit at spelling but never the less my dad ended up comparing me to him. he started browsing videos of how much more smarter this child was then me. he then happened to come across the child playing super mario 64 i think it was. he instantly clicked away saying why would such a smart child play video games. he then praised this child as if it was the second coming of christ and proceeded to rant at me on why i was a stupid child. i then remarked that he didn't know how to spell or know the meaning of anythese words let alone pronounce them. he then told me to shut up and continued on his preeching of the second coming of christ and how i was basically the anti christ. bare in mind he acutally didn't talk about christ as i live in "muslim" household.

 my mom is a reasonable person. she listens to to logic. unless in involves religion or my farther.

 so i'm a huge game fanatic. i also consider myself a critic albeit a shit one. that makes me resistant to the shit ubisoft likes to feed me. i mostly pc game but i own consoles aswell. i'm not allowed to go outside not even to go to my freinds house. the only time i go out in my free time is when i went comicon months ago with my freinds but that took hours of begging and me being ignored. so naturally gaming is my only form of escapism. i also read books like game of thrones and such. i play with freinds. but this all stopped when i came home after having gcse 6th period basically meaning i'm coming home late. but i have to go to a mosque and learn the quran their. now i haven't gone in weeks due to school and i wasn't planning on going today either. my parents however had other plans. they told me to go. i asked them nicely can i not go. they started cursing at me and saying i was possesed. i consider my agnostic but am irl a muslim. if i told them i was agnostic the shit they'd pull would be extremely hostile. so i don't. my dad said okay he have doesn't have to go. he then proceeded to take everything in my room starting my pc. he even took my shitty chair. all he left me with was my bunk bed that i share with brother. he told me that the pc was the reason i abandoned god. he then had the audacity to set my pc up in his room. bare in mind that he often goes on my pc for my video editing software that i help him with. 

 skip a few days and i haven't talked with him. he had my phone but my mom gave it back. i try to stay away from home but they call the school and asked them to monitor me. it's saturday now. my dads files got deleted because he's a fucking moron when it comes to computer. so he got really angry at me. he came into my room and decided to blame his incompetence on me. i told him i didn't do anything and he decides to smash everything in my room,sweep my shelves and kick my shit around till everything was broken. my revisions guides,essays years of work and my drawing all destroyed. now my bedroom smells of orange juice and my leg is bleeding from broken glass. 

i system restored the computer but hes acting as if i dont exist. nothing is appealing him.

 all i want to do is go back to gaming. gaming media has tuaght me all i know. not to take shit from companies l learnt from total biscuit and jim fucking sterling son. i learnt not everyone is a douchebag on youtube from inthelittlewood. i learnt that not all companies are ubisoft from devolver digital's games. i learnt fancy words from yahtzee which helped me in debate club. 
i don't want to report my family or anything. i don't want to lose my mom (even when she's unreasonable when my dads around sometimes). i don't want to leave my brother. i just want go back to gaming.

reddit i need your help.

Input: Text: i am currently on a music tour in italy, sharing a room with four other men. obviously not having had sex since the day before we left for the one week trip, tensions were running high, and my extremely horny girlfriend back home was sending me intimate messages, which was not helping in any way. by day four of the trip, i was climbing up the walls with sexual frustration, not having had a wank in all of this time (this is not a long time i know, but needs must). it was early on the morning on the fifth day, and i was the first person in the room up. i went to have a shower in our room bathroom and i took phone with me, and checked my messages. i had received some photos from my girl back home, which didn't leave much to the imagination, and i couldn't take it any longer: so i had a speedy wank in the shower. but after i had finished, i couldn't see where the 'produce' had gone due to the colour of the tiles, so i assumed it had been washed down the plug hole so i left it, with my conscience clear. a short 15 minutes later, one of my room mates opened the shower door after having just showered with a pained expression on his face. it turns out he was very tired and had decided to sit down in the shower, and had ended up sat in my sticky pile of sperm. he didn't realise, went to dry off, and wiped it onto his towel, which he then used to wipe his face, and smeared into his eye. my first reaction was to blame the poor innocent guy who sleeps in the bed next to me, who was still asleep, and said he had done it the night before. none of the room is talking to him, and he is still denying it to everyone.

Input: Text: tifu a few years ago. was working on a movie (small low- budget indie), the director was a friend who basically knows everything there is to know about filmmaking, from screenwriting to lighting to shooting. because it was such a super low budget thing we only had one rental truck that stored camera gear, grip/electric gear, and a few things got other departments here and there. we obviously didn't have teamsters, so my friend asked me to drive the truck to set, and he would prep for the day instead of having to drive.

so anywho truck is running low on fuel one morning (i had said we should fill up the night before but he didn't want to stop). i hop out, put the company card into to dispenser of gasoline which has both unleaded and diesel, grab the unleaded, and start pumping.

i pump blissfully for oh about 20 gallons when oh shit. like a ton of bricks.

i know that if one even starts a diesel truck that has unleaded fuel in can potentially ruin the engine, if you drive it will definitely ruin it. i don't think there's any way to fix it.
i debate whether i should just walk away and never look back, get an office job where you don't suddenly get asked to drive a truck and wake up at 4:00a and you can sleep and sit in a chair. 
but then i manned up and opened the truck door, and said: '(director?) i just put unleaded in the truck'. he didn't believe me at first. i ran to my pickup truck a mile down the road, drove back to the truck, we loaded up the camera gear and a flag kit and bounce card (which by a miracle from god was all we needed for that day, bc we were doing steadicam shots outside, using natural light), and drove like hell to get to set. truck was towed and siphoned, we got all we needed for the day.

amazingly, the director said nothing about my fuck up to anyone. when people obviously asked where the truck was/what happened, he told them he put unleaded in the truck. good guy. i was extremely impressed. he also didn't yell or freak out during the craziness. not a single harsh word. good dude.

so imagine me, a young 20 year old with a  bright and cheery disposition, working in an ice cream shop in a very (very) small town. at this particular time, a fairly decent little rush of touring people came in. it quickly got very loud in the building, but as my only coworker was on break, i took it upon myself to both tend the cash register and scoop the ice cream. nothing new!

but alas, there was something new! we just got a new flavor, coconut pinapple. now here's the thing: the person working the cash register writes the tags, and then hangs them to be filled. when we do so, we abreviate the flavors. coconut pinapple became "cp." as i wrote it for the first time, i thought, "wow, that's the same letters as child porn. better not say child porn."

well, i eventually filled the first order, and i yelled, above the crowd, "who had the single cup of child porn?"
my boss freaked out, i went on break immediately. after i explained, she laughed her ass off and the day went on.

Input: Text: okay i’ll start off by saying that this didn’t happen today, but exactly a week ago (pancake tuesday for the christian homies). tl;dr at the bottom. 


i, like many others, am currently suffering with a case of bcs syndrome (broke college student syndrome). the symptoms can be quite horrendous, and can often land you in some pretty sticky situations. for example, the opportunity of receiving things for free is one not to be ignored. yes, the mere mention of the word “free” in a college email or pamphlet is bound to result in a crowd of dozens of students, clambering to get their free pen or condom or whatever the student union decided to give away this week.
 
there are however, risks when availing of such things. 

it was 9am, i stumbled into class to see my excited friend throw me her phone, offering me an email to read (an email that i, and everyone had also received, but who in god’s name has the energy to check their email before midday?). i didn’t read the email properly of course, as the only thing i noticed were the words “free pancakes”. of course we promptly told our other friends and they too were thrilled at the idea of free food, so we copied the address into google maps, and made our way to the mysterious building of free pancakes. 

i should inform you at this stage that i am an atheist, i was raised by atheists who allowed me to choose my own religion, was sent to catholic school (it was hard to find a non-religious school in ireland in the 90’s) and, around age 15, i decided that i didn’t believe in any of the religions that were presented to me. i should also say that i have absolutely nothing against religion, i have respect for people regardless of what they believe in, and it’s just not for me. also, most of the people in my class are atheists, including everyone that accompanied me on the “free pancakes” adventure.

so we got to this house, my friend with the google maps stopped, “this is it!”, she said, an uneasy smile on her face. we all knew something wasn’t right about this. we had ended up in a housing estate, a cul de sac, a suburban array of houses. and here we were, six 20-something year old girls, standing outside this pretty normal looking house. (usually, when the college has any sort of  event or cook-out, it occurs on campus, in the student centre or one of the surrounding buidings, not in some house..)

well of course we had to at least ring the doorbell, there was free food at stake. 

we were greeted by this rather friendly (but very rather old) priest. yes, a priest. needless to say we were seriously confused at this point. “ah come in, come in! put yer bags in the spare room there. come into the kitchen!”.  we subtly looked at one another and then threw daggers at the girl who originally suggested this trip. “ah go on in there to the sitting room and i’ll make ye a cuppa tea!”, said the priest, who we had now learned was called fr. dave. 

we entered the sitting room, which was surprisingly full of students! each wall was lined with chairs so there was about 20 students plus us, so this came as quite a relief as we honestly thought we were the only ones to have shown up. 

well the pancakes were glorious. there was a table packed with jars of nutella, honey, syrup, marshmallows, and cream. and i must say that was the best cup of tea i’ve had in a while. yes, it was all going great. then they started to talk about god. now i would’ve been perfectly okay with that, i would’ve went along with it out of politeness, if i knew anything about god or the bible.  we were sat in a circle and as we went around, we thanked god for something good in our lives, then we asked one another what our favourite part of the bible was. i have never read the bible, but it sure seems like an interesting book. yes, our little act was coming along quite nicely; we had thanked god for generic college related crap (like good grades or friends and such), we even managed to get through the bible part by making up some crap about not being able to choose the best part and bashfully smiling at the rest of the people present. but then came the prayer. 

of course (and this was also out of pure politeness, we did eat their pancakes after all) we awkwardly sat and kind of half mimed the prayers that we obviously didn’t know (i knew the our father from primary school but that was it). it was going pretty great, that is until one of my friends started getting looks from the guy across from her, as he had obviously copped that she was miming.

she threw a hissy fit. now, she didn’t scream or anything, but she did storm out of the room in a huff whilst saying something along the lines of “i’m not f*cking religious anyway, i just wanted free pancakes for f*ck sake”. now, in ireland, it is the norm to be polite to people, it is also the norm that one is to be very polite and courteous when one is a guest in someones house, and to also be extremely polite to priests. so obviously, you can see where this was going. 

to say we were embarrassed is an understatement. there was a second or two (it honestly felt like hours) when the rest of us just sat there, everyone staring at us, before we realised it was time to go, and fast. we booked it out of there, collected our bags, and headed toward the door, trying to thank the priest for his hospitality like nothing happened.

well it is once again tuesday, and we received another email. “free tacos”. my friend actually wants to go back there because she thought they were so nice and they would “surely understand if we explained our situation to them”. i’m not sure the tacos are worth it.
Response list: ['i got free pancakes at a house in ireland, and i was awkwardly miming the prayers of a priest, and i was embarrassed.']
Ground truth: was lured to a priest’s house with pancakes, got caught up in prayer because it turned out to be some christian union type deal and they thought we were christian. oh, and my friend pretty much cussed out a priest.

Input: Text: so, i have a little bit of social anxiety.  well, more than a little bit.  i have been doing fairly well recently at working on that, but this may have set me back somewhat.

i was on the train heading home from work, and it's about an hour's journey, so it is especially irritating when i have to listen to other people's music turned up too loud on the commute.  especially through buds that make it sound all tinny.  the guy sitting behind me had his music up quite loud, playing on his phone.  i think i may have misophonia, as certain sounds just agitate the shit out of me.  but normally the anxiety makes me suck it up and not say anything.

i tried my first tactic in such situations - put on my own headphones, which cover the ears and actually do a fairly decent job at blocking out all but the worst, even if i don't turn on any music myself.

i could still hear it quite loudly.  so i started playing a video on my laptop (through the headphones, of course!), but still i could hear this grating music over the top.

i'd seen the guy a lot on my train before.  he seemed a normal enough guy.  so (surprising myself) for probably only the third time in my life, i tapped the guy on the shoulder (he was behind, but sitting sideways), and said in the most polite voice i could muster "hey, can you please turn the music down a bit... it's quite loud... ...thanks".  he was engrossed in his sudoku game on the phone and did not respond.  i tapped again and as he turned to me, i again said "can you please turn the music down a bit... it's quite loud".

he stared straight into my soul with his black eyes.  and said nothing.  after what seemed like eternity, he said in a very controlled and deliberate manner "**really?**".  i was confused.  what kind of response was this?  my mind blanked on how to respond.  i tried to say something again and he cut me off with another "**really?**", then added a menacing "**just turn around**!".  again my mind blanked.  what the fuck?  i must have looked like i was going to say something, because he repeated that menacing "**turn around**!".  i noped out of this confrontation and tried to regain some dignity with a confused "*ooooooookkkkkkaaaaayyyy.....*" as i turned to face forward.

of course my anxiety and obsessive mind now have me trying to analyse this incident and work out just what i did wrong.  did i not sound as polite as i thought?  is it really that rude to ask someone to turn their music down a bit?  needless to say i won't be doing that again for a while...
Response list: ['i asked a guy on the train to turn down his music, and he just turned around.']
Ground truth: asked stranger to turn his music down, got death stare and bizarre aggressive response**

Input: Text: this actually happened yesterday but nevermind. 

my parents are both very religous, i am not so religous, trust me that's important to the story.

i was sat in the car with my dad and we were listening to a political podcast which was mainly just three people screaming at eachother about nigel farage.

and i said: "this isn't unlike the podcast i listen to, although they're screaming about dick jokes more than immigration." 

and my dad looked at me like i'd just said the worst thing you could possibly say ever. "dick jokes? do you think that's appropriate listening material?" he asked

"sure" i mumble, uncertainly. "why not? i mean it's normally just me sat in my room with headphones on, so none of you can get offended by them"

dad sighs and asks "do you think jesus listened to dick jokes?"

"yes sure, why not *i mean he had a penis right?*" i answer, still a little unsure of whether i'm digging too far.

"what so judas just said to jesus, 'hey, heard the one about the arab with the massive boner?' and also jesus didn't have a penis." my dad responsed.

me and my dad argued on this for the whole time we were in the car and have not spoken to eachother since, and it was about 24 hours ago.

Input: Text: last year of college i was violently ill with some variety of respiratory illness (probably the flu) -- sore throat, coughing, runny nose -- the usual unpleasantness. i was unable to eat very much other than applesauce, nyquil, and cough drops for about a week and i had begun to grow very hungry. 

one evening, my sore throat had begun to subside and i could once again eat solid food. unfortunately, i arrived about 30 minutes before my university's cafeteria closed and the only food remaining was fried chicken. i swiftly bought my box of nuggets and fries and walked back to my dorm room (i didn't have a roommate that year). i devoured my prize, washed it down with a carbonated beverage, and drifted off to sleep.

at precisely 3:00 a.m. the next morning i felt a prodigious urge to evacuate my bowels. "sweet merciful jesus", i exclaimed as i leapt from my lofted bed to frantically search for my shoes. bent over double, cloaked in darkness, my hands closed around my shoes at the very moment that my predicament went from bad to very fucking bad.

it was like a jackson pollock painting: the door, the walls, the cold, and formally gray, tile floor were completely covered. i stared in disbelief, a steady steam of expletives pouring from my mouth as a fetid odor permeated the room. i spent the better portion of an hour and the majority of my cleaning supplies disinfecting the room only to discover that it had leaked under my door and into the hall, and was turning a crescent-shaped section of the hall a rich, dark brown. 

after i finished cleaning i walked to the showers at the end of the hall and bathed -- all the while muttering, "how the fuck did that just happen". mid-way through my shower i hear a group of very inebriated girls enter the bathrooms (all bathrooms in my building were co-ed). when i finished showering i realized, to my horror, in my haste to get clean i brought only a bar of soap, my keys, and the soiled clothes i was wearing. i waited for a few minutes until i heard the cackling laughter of drunken girls exit the bathroom and fade away. i gathered my belongings and walked, butt naked, right into the same group of girls who were hanging out in the hallway talking.

Ground truth: -- i ate mostly nyquill and cough drops for a week, had some fried chicken, shit all over my dorm room, and then walked fully nude into a group of very drunk (and very attractive) women while clutching my shit-soaked tighty-whities.

Input: Text: like most of the posts here, this didn't actually happen today, instead it happened a couple of days ago.

a little bit of context: i'm a student, so of course money is always an issue. in order to deal with this, i have a part time job at a local cinema for minimum wage which just about covers my expenses. recently, there have been issues with the rota leaving us short staffed and in desperate need in cover.

so, i got a phone call saying that they desperately needed me to come in for a few hours to help out behind retail. so being the good little employee that i am, i obliged, figuring the little bit of extra cash couldn't hurt at the end of the month. 

everything was going fine, customers weren't complaining, popcorn was selling etc. until we had a break, where nothing was going to happen for a while; so i decided it'd be the perfect opportunity to check my phone and reply to any messages that i'd missed. now this is where i fuck up. once i'd finished using my phone, i go to put it back in my back pocket - where it normally lives when i'm working - but i miss, and it hits the floor and bounces a little. my heart skips a beat, but everything seems to be fine..phew.

but how i was wrong. slowly, little bits of purple started to appear on the screen, the calibration began to get a bit buggy, and the purple spread. turns out, that somehow, i'd cracked the lcd panel behind the screen. my phone quickly became unusable and i had to endure the bus home with no music.

the next day i visit the lovely people of samsung who say they can fix it. for a price. two hours and £180 later, my phone is fixed and my bank account is in negatives. as a student, this hurt, because as i mentioned at the start, my job only just covers my expenses.

so that reddit, is how i fucked up, hopefully you found this more entertaining than i did.

well, anyway, we won the game tonight which means we advance to the next round (hurrah!). at the end of the game, my band director called us all down to talk to us about when we leave, what we need, etc. me, being really fucking excited (and tired from having stood for twoish hours straight), decided to hurry down the stairs. this next part felt like slow motion. i missed several steps, tripped on the bottom step, and landed on my back on the floor. of course, i'm laughing my ass off but several people, including my band director are asking me if i'm okay, helping me up, etc.
i didn't get out of this unscathed, i have a pretty sizeable bruise on my ankle now  and a small brush burn. definitely not my worst injury, and it could have ended worse. still, pretty embarrassing when you consider that hundreds of people saw it happen.
Response list: ['i tripped on the bottom step, got a bruise on my ankle and a small burn.']
Ground truth: i'm an idiot, fell down some stairs in front of pals and basketball fans because i wasn't paying attention

Input: Text: so this was back in the summer of 2012. i went to see the almighty maiden in clarkston, mi and got some decent seats around the 5th or 6th row. as soon as i got there, i started making some small talk with a group sitting to my left, who came from the french speaking part of canada to see the band perform. i threw around some of the little french i knew and we talked about our favorite iron maiden songs, etc.  

fast forward to the ending of the concert. now, if you've been to one of these rock concerts, you know that at the end, the musicians will just start throwing their guitar picks and drumsticks to the crowd. well, the moment arrived and me and my new french speaking friends were really trying to grab anything that was thrown our way. another detail is that while i am more of a casual listener of iron maiden, they were huge fans. they were desperate, i was more of "it'd be cool to get something".

another detail is that it is not uncommon for picks to get thrown and not get caught by anybody. so as this fan frenzy is going on around us, the guy to my left decides to search for picks under the seats in front of us. at this moment, i see the drummer, nicko mcbrain, has brought out some signed drum heads and is throwing them into the crowd. since this venue has these chairs that are bolted to the ground with a retractable seating part, i decide to climb up onto the stationary part, rise above the crowd and reach for one of those coveted drum heads.

with one foot on the bolted part of the chair and the other on the reclined seating part, my balance was not the best and so i didn't have much time. despite this, nicko sees me. yes! he'll surely frisbee a drum head my way! success! oh wait...no, he's turning around to make a joke as if i was looking at something behind him...

wait, there's more. what's this? one of the security people comes to tell me i couldn't climb the seats and need to get down from where i was. cool, i understand them doing their job... but the guard told me with both words and a slight tug.

yep. you guessed it. i lost my balance and fell forward. not a problem, as i was landing on my feet... just not on the floor... remember when i said the guy beside me was looking for picks under the seats in front? i landed with not one, but both feet on his back. i could hear the loud gasp from this guy, who got up immediately. i swore he was going to punch my daylights out right there and then for using him as a skateboard. 

luckily, he didn't. i apologized profusely and he was visibly shaken, but let it go thankfully. and so we all walked out of the venue, empty handed...
Response list: ['i got a drum head thrown at me, i fell down, and i got a drum head thrown back at me.']
Ground truth: went to maiden concert. guy beside me crouched to find guitar picks on the floor, i climbed on the seats to get stuff. lost my balance, fell forward and stomped on the guy's back like mario stomping a goomba.

after lunch i'm sitting in my car playing wiiu, finishing my baha blast when i go to fart and baha blast my pants. see i'm out of cash and just been using my credit card. it seemed logical in my position to only eat once a day too. so taco bell after not eating with my stomach = poo in the pants. but it's like you have lots of iffy farts... you gotta check. so i stick my finger in my pants and pull it out covered in liquid shit. lucky i already have water proof seat covers. and i had a towel close by to put under me. but now i have to drive, one hand with shit on it, to a discreet bathroom.

Input: Text: this happened around 2 months ago at school. my friend and i were throwing a football around and everything was going well. he said he was going to throw a bullet pass, which means any sane receiver is going to throw 2 hands up to catch it. not yours truly though, i was going to one hand this pass. it was a perfect spiral throw, i put out my hand and wham! the ball flies behind me and i feel an intense pain in my thumb. it bent backwards when the ball hit it. i knew immediately it was a sprain. i continued playing football after a quick break to let the initial pain subside. it hurt to move for a few weeks and i re-aggravated it a couple of times but it eventually healed for the most part. however, it still hurts a little and pops when i tuck my thumb in my fist or when i bend it back at a certain angle so i may have a completely torn a ligament and now caused permanent damage because i thought it was too minor to see a doctor.

Input: Text: so like most tifu's, this didn't happen today but a few months ago. 

i was walking my dog around the block and since i live really close to the beach, my street is full everyday in the summer. it's not uncommon for me to get stopped by people asking for directions or guys cat calling me so i usually think nothing of it.

as i near the corner back to my house, a man in this nice ass brand new car motions/calls me over. so i go there and it's this big sexy black man and sitting in the passenger seat is this girl next door type white girl. off the bat i could tell they have money. she was wearing a nice dress and a diamond necklace and he was dressed well. so he starts talking about how he loves my hair (white girl with dreads) and then he starts getting a little weird. i could tell he was drunk or off the shits. he says "you can never be with a white man, know why??" and i'm like uhh and he goes "you would confuse him lookin like that. you need a black man in your life. i can find you a black man. come around and see my son. i want you to see my zebra baby". yes. zebra baby. at this point i keep telling him i'm going home but he keeps telling me what to do and like the naive girl that i am, i listen. so i go around and they both get out the car. he leaves his door open and opens the back door so i could see his toddler. he tells me to touch his hair and feel his dreads so i do. he tells me he can get me a man to make a zebra baby with. and then he goes "kiss him on the cheek". and i'm like uhh... so i pinch his cheek. and he goes "no kiss him on the cheek" in this stern ass voice so i do. i kissed a random toddler on the cheek. so then this guy is all happy and he's like "i like her baby get her number" so this lady whips out her brand new iphone. i give her my real number and she calls it right away since my phone is in my hand. at this point i'm like i really got to go home and he makes me give them hugs and i leave. like an idiot, i walk right into my house which is right across the street. 

so when i get inside i'm like wtf happened that was so weird. i look up the area code of the number and its from new mexico. i dont live anywhere near new mexico. so the next day when i go to school i tell my class about this funny incident and they laugh but are all like wtf is wrong with you why didn't you leave. and my teacher with this dumbfounded look on his face goes "that is exactly how every story of human trafficking starts." and immediately everything clicks. i don't know how i didn't understand that this was a pimp who wanted to sell me despite the fact that he told me straight up he could find me a black man to make zebra baby's with. i'm an idiot.

it was a typical spring day, and i was in middle school, sitting in class and talking to a friend. i don't remember the details, but he told me a joke that i found extremely funny. for some odd reason, i responded to his joke by laughing hysterically and ended up whipping my head in a downward motion towards the desk where a mesh binder was placed. i had braces at the time, so they somehow ended up getting caught in some of the lacing of the mesh binder. the binder was something like this : http://cheapbinderstores.blogspot.com/2013/05/case-it-velcro-closure-2inch-ring-binder.html

Input: Text: so i live in a hostel room with a roommate. i cash out amount of 500 from atm because my friend needed it. he returns after he is able to. now i have 500 cash that should be in my atm but is in my wallet now. too lazy and busy to go to bank to deposit it.
i am going outside on a trip and feel 500 cash in my wallet is too risky as i might lose it if my wallet gets stolen. our drawers and cupboard don't have any locks so trying to figure out where to put the money. after much thinking, have this brilliant idea to hide it in one of random envelopes in my drawer. that way even if someone looks inside my drawer, they can't find it unless they open all the envelopes, also please note the drawer is very messy with all sorts of useless things in there so envelopes don't stand out. 
i come back from trip, all is well, time passes by. recently after two months, discovered the hidden 500 cash, and i'm like when did i hide this note here? i make a mental note to use that cash late. leave it there now.
week later, i'm running out of cash, remember i had that 500 in that envelope. open drawer, look for the envelope, can't find it. search all the envelopes, every single thing. can't find it. then memory immediately flashes back to week earlier when i was cleaning my room. the drawer was open and i think i took the envelope and without fucking checking it and threw it in the trash can. i didn't check because all envelopes were useless . now, i am all sad that i lost 500 because of my carelessness, laziness and stupidity.

Input: Text: okay, so, for context: my family was dog-sitting for another family while they were away. instead of driving 35 minutes to their house and back 2-3 times a day, we decided to just keep the dog at our house. their dog is a young, havanese-shi-tsu mix (i think). his name is loki. and he is a devil dog.

okay, time for the story:

so, the entire family, human and canine alike, was in my parents' room talking (i don't remember about what). well, loki kept jumping on the bed. we told him to get off. we wouldn't mind, normally, but he just *would not* leave us alone. it was getting annoying, so we sent him out of the room and closed the door.

mistake #1. he gets seperation anxiety. you can't even leave the room without him or he'll start whining. so of course, that's what he did.

well, eventually, i decided to head to my room (next door). my brother, parents, and the other dogs were still in the master bedroom. i didn't want to deal with loki at the moment, so i closed my door as well.

mistake #2. about 30 seconds after i did so, he started barking. eventually, i got fed up with hearing it, so i opened my door to let him in, and just hoped he would ignore me.

mistake #3. apparently, my dog, jake, had also gotten out of my parents' room. i don't know how. before i could really register, he had wandered into my room.

now, normally, this wouldn't be a problem. however, loki is territorial/food aggressive. we had been keeping a crate there for feeding/sleeping. because of the conflict of interests, we had been trying to keep the other two out of my room.

jake, being curious about the new addition to my room since the last time he had been in there, decided to investigate the crate.

loki had a problem with that.

he started out growling and barking, and of course, i tried telling him no and calming him down, while simultaneously pulling jake from the room.

in seconds, however, he had escalated to full-on attacking him.

jake, of course, fought back. 

my first instinct was to try and separate them. pulling their harnesses didn't work, being loud didn't work, pushing them away from each other by the chest didn't work, so, my last resort was to just stand between them until they stopped.

it worked, but not before loki gave me a nasty gash from his claw (seriously, those things need trimmed. they are *deadly*).

of course, when i did this, i wasn't worried about my dog's chances in the fight. jake is a golden retriever, and he's big, even for one of those. he's got a good, strong bite (i learned this from playing tug-of-war with him). needless to say, he's fairly capable of defending himself. so no, i wasn't worried about saving him from this dog.

i was worried about saving the other dog from him.

you see, he doesn't normally get aggressive. in fact, in the 2+ years i've had him, he hasn't so much as snarled at anyone. the most aggressive thing he's done is chase a cat, and if he actually caught one, i highly doubt he'd actually kill it. this week, however, he's been aggressive 3 times, including this incident, all directed towards loki. he apparently got just as fed up as the rest of us, because, while the first two times, he just growled and snapped at him for a second or two, this time, he didn't stop.

so yeah. i can post a picture, if people want to see the gash. if it scars, it'll look really cool.

 

edit: by the way, if you have a dog, or are thinking about getting one, please, please, *please,* do not baby them. they will turn into aggressive, entitled little jerks.

edit 2: someone asked for the picture, so [here](https://m.imgur.com/account/halfging3r/images/q25aw3t) it is.
Response list: ["my dog, loki, got a nasty gash from his claw on my brother's chest."]
Ground truth: devil dog got territorial with my dog and tried to attack him. my dog is at least 4 times his size. i was forced to intervene, and got a nasty scratch for my efforts.

Input: Text: so as follows, this didn't happen today.

as a young kid i was very adventurous, always looking for something new to do or to plat with. i was very interested in fire and trains, two things you shouldn't mix. anyway, my neighbour had this train set, a massive one, that was spread through their entire garage. it was all set up, the train would have tunnels and bridges and it was amazing. or so i thought. me being me bugged my parents for months to buy me one but they never would as it was always about money and how much things would cost etc etc. i really wanted to use the train set my neighbours had.

this is where the **fu** happens. 

my neighbours went out one afternoon but ended up leaving their garage open. i seized this opportunity and entered the garage to fulfill my 10 yr old selfs dream of using this train set. like i said, i was very interested in fire as well. so after playing with the set for a while, i saw a pack of matches lying a few meters away from the set, not sure why it was there. i decided to put some newspaper in one of the carriages and set it on fire to replicate coal burning. i know coal doesn't burn there now. anyway a few moments after doing this the carriage falls off the track, little 10 yr old me just freaks out and runs.

the entire garage ends up going up in flames and i think it spread to a bit of the house. to this day no one knows it was me although i feel my parents have suspicions. my neighbours had to replace everything in the garage and they ended up moving houses.

i was on a cruise ship, and i was hanging out in the arcade at around 12:30 a.m, bored out of my mind. i was with my cousin, and neither of us had any tickets left, and our parents cut off our spending. i found a ticket on the floor, and as a joke decided to jam it in the prize machines receipt slot. then, i printed a receipt for one ticket to try to push it out. when that didn't work, i finally got it out with my finger, and two receipts came out, each for one ticket. i was confused, then realized, i had just cloned a ticket!
   

i later figured out how it works. when i printed out the receipt, i blocked it from coming out. the machine doesn't realize it came out, so it lets you print another one, and then you clone those tickets too.
  

i then proceeded to use this to my advantage, buying out a bunch of prizes. i also let some of the other kids in the arcade in on it, and we basically emptied the prize machine. after that, everything started to fall apart.  
 

 more and more kids started to find out, and would do it right in front of the arcade staff. when the staff started noticing something was going on, they started paying more attention. at one point, i noticed one recording me on his phone, and i ran away as fast as i could. i would see them standing next to the machines all day, watching every kid carefully. i saw one machine open, and the guy was trying to fix it. i found out from a friend that they had caught some kid with a receipt for 300,000 tickets, when the most expensive prize was 2,500 tickets. the guy said to him, "hey, that's illegal, kid." and took him to their office.
  

  i avoided the arcade after that, but it was too late. when me and my family were coming back on to the ship from nassau, they were scanning our cards. they scanned mine, and the screen read, 'denied'. a crew member brought me to the cruise ship directors office, or whoever it is that runs the jail. he said to me, "we know what you did." i thought they might be bluffing, and acted confused. but then he took out a receipt for 300,000 tickets, and i realized i was done for. 


he told me what he had found out, and he said this. "so,  what we know is, one kid found a glitch in the machine, and he started showing people how to do it. and then he showed you, is that correct?". i realized i had a way out and said, "yes, that's right. that kid started the whole thing. a lot of the kids didn't know how he did it, he just gave them prizes and tickets." 
  

 the director made me return my prizes and tickets, and said that if i ever went back to the arcade, they would contact authorities. some of the other kids involved thanked me for not throwing them under the bus. i later found out the so-called "ringleader" was charged with a felony. they never found out that it was me.

update: i found an old journal entry, and apparently the director told me that we racked up 1.3 million tickets from the glitch. i remembered one of the toys, a remote control robot, cost 2000 tickets, and i did the math. i could have gotten 650 robots, and each robot sells for $20, so we potentially could have taken $13,000 worth of toy robots.
Response list: ['i cloned a ticket, and then used it to buy out a bunch of prizes. i let kids know how to do it, and they all got caught.']
Ground truth: i found a glitch in an arcade machine that gave me free tickets. shit got serious, and i avoided getting charged with a felony, but threw some other kid under the bus for it.

Input: Text: i am an overnight sitter for an elderly woman who lives in an assisted living apartment building. some nights after she's gone to bed, i walk down the hall to a nice screened in porch area to smoke a cig or 2 and call my boyfriend, play pokémon, browse reddit, etc. as it's screened in, i usually bring a cup to ash in and collect butts. last night, i had a half full mini water bottle in my bag and decided that would be much easier than using a cup, dumping the cup in the toilet, cleaning out the cup. all went well and as expected, it was a much easier and contained method. i didn't want to throw the bottle away in the room and risk anyone finding it, (my old lady has dementia and i often find her digging in trashcans) so i put the bottle back in my bag to discard on my way out in the morning. i opened my bag this morning to the enticing smell of old wet cigarettes. i hadn't sealed the bottle correctly, and the ash filled water had leaked onto my clothes, bra, shoes, and other sleepover essentials all night. it was nasty. so, for the rest of my shift i had to walk my old lady to breakfast and on her morning walk in my pajamas, braless, with damp cigarette shoes on. you know when someone walks in the room and you know that they must smoke in their bed with the windows and doors shut because they smell like a hundred ashtrays? that was me today at this very nice, expensive dorm for old people. 

on a happy note, it has prompted me to try to quit smoking again, and i passed up on buying another pack when i ran out today. silver linings, right?
Response list: ["i smoke in my old lady's room, and i smoke in my old lady's room."]
Ground truth: : spilled my homemade ashtray all over my clean clothes at work, spent the second half of my shift in a continuous walk of shame.

Input: Text: so this happened last year and i figured it might be a pretty good one to put on here.

my mom and dad are separated, but both still lived in the same town. my mom had just had some of the branches on her trees trimmed and was asking me if i could go drop them off at my dads in his backyard, since he was just going to use them for a bonfire. at the time, i was driving my dad's little old 87 ford ranger, so i loaded up the branches and drove over to my dad's house.

now, my dad's backyard is a huge sinkhole, but it's sloped enough that you can drive down around the edge of it and get to the bottom. he keeps all his firewood down at the bottom for bonfires, which is where i was taking the branches. so i drive the ranger into the backyard up on the high point, and open up the tailgate, and then stop and think,
"you know, i don't really feel like dragging these down, i think i'll just drive the truck down and drop them off and then drive it back up."

this was back when i was a little ignorant to driving off-road, and it had just been raining for the past two days and everything was muddy. so i drive the ranger down the slope of the sinkhole, drop off the branches, and then try to drive it back up. it's stuck. i sit there and spin the tires trying to get it to move, and it's totally buried in the rear now. i kinda start getting a little nervous, i tried putting a lever force on the axle with a bigger branch to get it out, putting branches under the wheels to give it traction, but to no avail. so i'm stuck at the bottom of a 100 foot sinkhole with an old ranger and no way of getting it out. 

then i had a brilliant idea. i could get my dad's brand new f150 and pull it out. he wouldn't be home for another two hours or so and if i got it out with the f150, we're golden. so i climb back up the sinkhole and go get the f150 and some tow straps. i put it in four wheel drive and everything, go down, and before i can even get it in position to hook up to the ranger, it's stuck too. i start freaking out. i call my mom and tell her what's going on and she comes over and tries to help but it's no use. looks like i'm just going to have to call dad.

i call my dad and he starts screaming at me. "you did what? i wouldnt even drive the ranger down there when its dry. its been raining for two days, hell why dont you just go drive the mustang down there too?" etc. it was very unpleasant. 

i spend the next two hours until he gets home trying to drive the f150 out, but it's only sliding deeper into the hole at this point and i'm not helping it any. 
my dad eventually got home and drove the f150 out by itself and then pulled the ranger up the hill with it.  i wasn't allowed to help with any of this because he was so mad at me he just told me to go inside.

moral of the story: laziness, might actually lead to working a lot harder than simply putting in the effort to do it the right way.
Response list: ["i tried to drop off firewood from my dad's house, and it ended up being buried in a sinkhole."]
Ground truth: i drove my dad's ranger into a sinkhole to drop off some branches instead of carrying them down like i should have and got it stuck. i tried driving the f150 down next and got it stuck too. dad was not happy.

Input: Text: of course, this wasn't today, this was maybe 1985.  i was a lazy teenager, like most of us i assume.  i didn't do much, but did well in school, played road hockey, and did squat at home.  i didn't do dishes, tidy up, pretty much nothing......until that day.

my mom and her longtime boyfriend broke up, so mom decided it was time to clean up her room to get rid of all the memories that could go away and move on with her life.  during the process, she put all the things she wanted to keep in a few garbage bags to keep them separate from the "bad" stuff.  these things included all of our school pics/report cards, family pics, keepsakes, etc.

my mom worked midnights, and we were out until it got dark of course, and for some reason she thought putting these bags of our lives at the front door.  me being the energetic and ever so helpful person that i was, i decided to put the garbage out that day.  i'm sure you can figure out the rest from here.

Input: Text: so about 6 hours ago i came to visit my so in college. she and her roommate just got tattoos and they were talking about it while i was humbly eating my wings. her roommate, we'll call her alex, said that she has to hide it from her dad or she's going to be dead. 

i ask alex what she got. she said she got the ursa major constellation and i sat and pondered for about 5 seconds and asked alex if that was the bear one. she said yes and i was trying to imagine how that could be done. she asks my so to show it to me. in my head i'm like "ez, it'll look like a bear with lines and shit."

wrong, horribly wrong. it's some half assed connect the dot bullshit with like two really big hack jobs of "brighter stars" and some other garbage. i kinda twisted my face up in a way that said "wtf" and she immediately noticed.

alex says "what the fuck was that?" and i was like "what?" she said "the look on your face. it was kinda shitty." and i was like "oh." then she gets super defensive and is trying to bait me into arguing with her and i say "nothing. never mind." finally she gets pissy, starts throwing shit and just recently stormed out of the room.

also i think it's worth mentioning that she was already regretting it but the quality of the tattoo caught me off guard and it resulted in this.

now my so is begging me to apologize and try to make up with her because she's going to be gone for 6 hours tomorrow.

i don't know why i did it, i'm not normally a prejudiced jackhole. i was picked on as a kid and i know how it hurts to be made fun of. but nonetheless, on an impulse born of pure dickheadedness, i leaned in and quietly said to my friend sitting across from me, "hey, check out the midget over there."

her back was to this little person and her friends. when my friend heard "over there" it didn't occur to her that it could possibly mean "directly fucking behind you" cause she loudly and enthusiastically turned around exclaiming, "ooh! a midget! where?!"

the little person looked over in shock. her friends looked at us like we were scum (accurate). my friend turned back facing me and died inside at what she had just done. we have never spoken of this incident since.

Input: Text: you know how people always say "don't miss leg day?" yeah, that shit is true. do not miss leg day.

so i've been doing p90x3 for a while and my body is starting to get used to working out. but, like everyone else, the main reason i'm doing the program is to have a rockin' bod. and so i focus my efforts on the muscles that will help that image. pecks, biceps, triceps, shoulders, abs, etc. the last thing on my mind is my lower half, so i skipped workouts dealing with those muscle groups.

so at about halfway through this program i took pictures to see my progress from day one. i wasn't expecting much, but i was surprised that i could see a bit of difference. after poppin' chub for the new me, i realized that i had become a bit of a monster. i was gaining definition up top, but my legs retained that chicken look. 

naturally, i wanted to resolve this issue and i decided tonight would be the best time to really lay on the leg workouts. squats. lunges. kicks. other leg things. you name it, i did it. and by god, i could feel that it was working. my legs were quivering with this work and i was proud.

this is where things go south.

i walked upstairs to take my post-workout shower. it was difficult to get up the two flights of stairs, which was odd, but i didn't pay it any mind. i started the shower and hopped inside.

the warm water felt like liquid jesus and i stood there thinking i was hot shit. everything from singing to myself to doing poses in my shower mirror. not my proudest moment. after being a little narcissistic bitch, i looked down and saw my member could use a haircut.

you see where this is going.

i picked up the razor like it was fucking excalibur and went to town. keep in mind i'm on an endorphine high from exercising and my judgment is not at its peak by this point. 

my legs start to randomly spasm as a reaction to heavy use and the violent shaking causes me to slice my scrotum. i screamed like a child as drops of blood fell to the shower floor.

so now i have a family that is now awake, a bleeding scrotum, and legs that won't stop shaking. fan-fucking-tastic.

i gotta admit, when the immediate pain subsided, my first thought wasn't to seek help or fix my bloodied penis, it was "this might make a decent tifu." i am ruined. i need to relax on the redditing.

so i patch up my cock and assure parents that i am fine. it could have been much worse, but it still stings like hell. typed this bad boy up and now i'm gonna sleep it off. who knows, mini me might be okay for a morning round if i'm lucky. jk

Input: Text: not today, but when i was a freshman. 

in our first physics class of the semester, my friends and i go sit at the back of the lecture hall, where roughly 600 students would attend.  as we sit, i spot a girl (let's call her megatron) who attended primary school with me and one of my friends (let's call him goku), as she is coming into the hall way at the front.  i ask the friend next to me (let's call him unintentionalloser), who didn't attend the same primary school, to pass on the message to goku that he should check it out, it is megatron from primary school.

meanwhile, goku is in conversation with someone, and unintentionalloser is just being polite, waiting for him to finish before relaying the message.  and, as murphy dictated, megatron strolled up all the way, past all the open chairs, and ends up sitting *right* in front of us.  this is perfectly in time with goku finishing with his engaging conversation.

my body stopped working in the utter astonishment at how the perfect, embarrassing fu came together, just long enough for unintentional loser, who didn't realise that it was in fact megatron who just sat down in front of him, to say "hey, goku, pgwolvpack said you should check it out, it's megatron from primary school".

...i rolled my window down at a parking garage ticket booth literally coming from the tint shop to my parking garage. the tint snagged on the window seal and completely ruined that tint job. even worse, i therefore also my voided the warranty. all because i accidentally rolled my window down at a location i have been rolling my windows down for months, day in and day out.

Input: Text: by today i mean several years ago.

i was 10-11 years old and i loved biking. i had just gotten a new bike for my birthday, and it was a huge upgrade from the bike i had before. this new one shifted gears, and had two brakes! so cool!

it was a couple days after my birthday, and i was out riding my bike.  my parents thought i was smart enough to ride on the opposite side of cars on the road, which i was, so they allowed me to ride on the road nearby our house. (we live in a rural area, so barely any cars pass through here anyway) i had found out a while earlier that if you press the front brake you stop quicker , which is nice (i had only tested this going slowly). my house has large hills near it, both on the road and off, and i was having fun riding down those. it was great, until i found myself going down a hill faster than i intended to, quickly accelerating towards a wall of trees.

i tried the front brake trick and surprise surprise, and i was catapulted off my bike as it bounced right over my head and careened into the trees. i was lying there on the ground (thankfully grass) about 10 feet away from the trees, with blood all over my face and arms. i wasn't too far from my house, maybe a minute's walk at most. my juvenile mind tried to comprehend what just happened but i think i was too distracted by all the blood.

i eventually got off the ground, crying and shaking, and went to look at the bike. my brand new bike i had gotten a few days prior was bent, missing the seat, had a huge dent in the front rim, and the chain wasn't mounted (wrong word?) i got back to my house around 10 minutes after i crashed,  blood dripping from my arms and face, and my parents were scared shitless by the sight. thankfully my mom was a nurse and was able to clean and bandage me up, and the injuries weren't too bad, just a lot of scrapes.

Ground truth: i pressed only my front brake while going down a hill, i was catapulted over the handlebars, and went home covered in blood with a broken bike.

Input: Text: hello, this is my first tifu post and i am currently typing this on my phone at work.

so last night i went to bed early knowing i had to wake up at 5 to get ready for work today. now i am not a morning person and i do get cranky if i am waken up before i am suppose to be. so then, last night at 2 a.m. i am waken up by a noise of chatter that grew louder and louder within each second outside my window. at this point i am deciding whether or not i should go check.

30 seconds later i am angry and go check what the hell is going on outside my window. i see a group of guys in the dark (like 10 of them) at 2am outside my window. then i hear the front door of my house open and i knew it was my sister and that those were all her friends standing outside my window waiting for her to open the door that leads into my basement.  ( probably to pary)

at this point i am furious with the obnoxious talking outside my window late at night. i am also very protective for my sister when i see a group of guys like that hanging out with her.

i come to the window and bang it as loud as i can to try to get them to shut up. they did for about 10 seconds. and then it grew loud again. i am very angry. 

i walk out of my room to confront my sister about the situation. at this point the whole house is woken up. i see my sister and shes asks me if i want to join her downstairs when she knows i have work in 2 hours. i flip out and and start to stomp the floor yell at her. i then punch the nearest thing next to me which was the wall. i punched it harder than i thought and it left a gaping hole in it. my parents were there and saw the whole thing in the dark. as soon as they heard he loud bang my hand left they knew what i had done to their precious walls. i then angrily walk back to my room to try to get any sleep. my parents tell my sister to send her friends home.

i left for work before my parents wake up. i know they are pissed because of what i did to their wall. my shift doesnt end until 3 hours where i have to face them.
Response list: ["i bang my sister's window at 2am and it left a gaping hole in my parents' walls."]
Ground truth: :  woke up by my sister's obnoxious friends in the middle of the night . got angry and punched a hole in the wall of my parents house. about to get a death sentence.

Input: Text: i'm using a throwaway for this for reasons that will be obvious by the end. 

my eldest child is autistic and entering puberty. she has a mechanical and detached way of thinking and this has made some aspects of sex education kinda challenging, as anything emotional tends to go over her head because she needs more clinical answers to get it.

i have this old iphone 3 that i formatted and set up for my kids to use for their youtube videos about minecraft, netflix watching but she uses it the most. one afternoon when i couldn't find my phone and needed to search for something i picked that one up, and as i began typing all her recent searches came up and they were all things like, "redtube" and "sex" and "two people having sex". neither my spouse nor i believe in snooping: privacy is important, especially when it comes to puberty and teenage years, but we also really don't want her poking around on hard core porn sites at this stage of her life.

she admitted to the searches when asked and wanted to understand more about what pornography was and why it existed. i was as honest and open with her questions as i could be, one of which was, "why is it not ok for kids to see it if you want to know what sex looks like?". i realized then that she'd wanted to know what sexual organs and bodies in the act of sex looked like. there was no titillation involved, just plain curiosity, and she had a hard time grasping what was so wrong about it if there were also books with drawings of sexual organs and depictions of sex in them that are specifically for teaching it to kids like her. that one was more complicated but i did my best. a long conversation of laws and maturing and boundaries really came down to, "a child your age should not be viewing adult bodies having sex, particularly pornography which isn't real sex at all" and that seemed to satisfy her. to be totally honest, i felt a little lost and wished i'd had more time to prepare a better speech but i was pretty confident i'd done a good job addressing it.

about a week later the same situation happened again with the old phone, but this time the search bar popped up things like, "aang sex", or "12 year old naked" and i immediately had a complete mental breakdown. all i could think about was the fbi raiding my house and seizing all our electronics and finding some sort of cache of child pornish sounding searches and getting added to a sex offender registry because i had inadvertently told my autistic child that she should limit her curiosity to something more age-appropriate and she took that way, way too literally.
Response list: ["i told my autistic child that she shouldn't see adult bodies having sex, and she took that way too literally."]
Ground truth: i am a horrible parent.

i decided i would like a refreshing can of pepsi, and the closest place to get it is at the vending machine in my student accommodation. the last row was the one filled with pepsi cans, and the first two slots in the row were empty, so i decided to go for the third one. being the programmer that i am, i count 0, 1, 2, put in my pound, and push the button for the last row, slot 2. trembling with anticipation of pepsi i look at the slot in the vending machine -the empty slot makes a movement releasing nothingness, and the vending machine eats up my money.

\*facepalm\*

 

context for the uninitiated: most programming languages work in such a way that it forces you to start counting from 0 instead of 1. so for example if a is a list of things, a[0] would be the first item in the list, a[1] the second and so on.

i broke my foot last weekend and have been on crutches for a few days. the doors at my workplace are extremely difficult to open in most places, and are typically unlocked by a little electric fob. this means i've got about 5 seconds to get to the door and get it open before the electric locks re-engage. my typical strategy is to swipe my fob, reposition my crutches, and then launch myself at the door in the hopes of applying enough force to open it before it locks again. 

i guess i've gotten in the habit of tackling doors open, because i was headed into the bathroom and opened the door by flinging myself into it. one of my coworkers was preparing to leave by that door at that exact moment. the door hit him in square in the face, and i collapse into the bathroom due to the unexpected resistance, and we both go down in a tangle of pain and crutches. it almost broke his glasses (he managed to bend them mostly back into shape), and he'll probably have a large linear bruise on his cheek and forehead tomorrow. 

at least i have the crutches for sympathy - i just pretended that i fell.

was heading down to my parents house to visit. stopped by kfc to get something to eat and get back on the interstate. as i’m trying to get back on, there’s a line of cars, all with hazard lights on, driving 30/40 on a 70mph road. i’m barreling down the on-ramp at 65mph trying to fin d a place to merge into traffic, but they’re all driving so close to each other. the car in front of me had to pull off to the side of the road because there’s no room left, but i see my chance! i step on the gas and cut two cars off to fleet ahead of these pack of weirdos. i look behind me and see most of them have stopped and the people in the on-ramp are heading on behind me. i feel like a savior that the people needed, but didn’t deserve! good job diddy!

as i’m flying by this 1 mile+ line of cars i’m thinking they’re all stupid for driving so slow. there’s no accident anywhere. no construction! i’m laughing at them when i decide to look at my phone and google “line of cars with their hazard lights on”. first thing that pops up is [this](https://www.funeralwise.com/learn/procession/) website. my laughter and jokes stop as i look up and see two hummer limos and a hearse. i finally got to the end of the car line and see he lead vehicle with the flags and hazard lights.

Input: Text: happened like a hour ago.  so as a young college student with an overwhelming sex drive i jerk off at least once a day.  normally im super careful about this and make sure that no one is in the house and that my door is closed in case anyone does come home at the time.  today however i have the house to myself and as such didn't really care about anything so i loaded up a good old chinese cartoon porno and just started to go at it.

recently however my dog has been spending an enormous amount of time with me since i am the only one home between 12pm to like 10pm.  this hasnt really been a problem before now so i did not even think about it before i started going ham.  

so here i am getting on with it watching the chinese cartoon characters go at it while stroking and i can tell it is almost time for it to end.  so i start feeling it and then here comes my dog just fucking staring at me as i'm about to finish.  i try to wave her off but to no avail she decided that the best place to be was on my fucking lap as i'm about to finish.  

i finish dog is covered in my special sauce and she runs the fuck away before i can grab her to throw her in the bath and wash her off.  so now i'm chasing my dog around the house trying to get her in the bath when she discovers my father left his door open as well so she jumps on his bed and starts rolling around on it.  great now the sheets need to be washed as well.  

i finally catch the little bitch and throw her in the bath to get her all cleaned up and here she is fucking looking incredibly happy and i'm miserable.

Input: Text: alright first off i'd like to point out i don't gift much especially to a girl, but today was different. i am also the kind of person that if i try something and it went bad, i will not do it again. this happened today by the way. let's begin!!

apologies in advance for long post.

backstory! so i guess i should of seen this coming in the first place. christmas eve, she asks me one question i will never forget (because it freaked me out), "so, what are you giving your crush for christmas?" (did i mention she knows and has a boyfriend... long story for another day my friends)  i had no words other than the ones in my head "oh fuck". so i really didn't know what she wanted for christmas, so i ask pathetically. (by pretending to be santa of course!) and basically got a good list of what she wanted. couldn't mess anything up right? wrong! first off i couldn't give her a gift until sometime after christmas. (today to be exact).

on the list had some standard stuff, movies, food and such but i didn't want to give those. so being the classy guy i try to be i saw that on the list she wanted a bracelet and i'm like cool can't possibly mess this up! (wrong again my friend). my plan was after i am done visiting family from all over i come back buy her a bracelet. well then my head starts to spin. she has a boyfriend... can't make this too serious. so i buy a fast food card (we both work fast food and i know she is sick of it) only a 5 dollar amount. after that nice save. i'm like ok time to buy it i guess. (let the fucking up begin). i run in run out bam nothing awkward happens. after i walk out of the store though... i immediately have a buyers remorse, but it wasn't enough to turn me over and return it. now when i got home that's when it hit me. constantly just saying to myself "maybe just a movie would do." but what prevented me for changing was telling myself i'm terrible and second guessing myself. like most of the time i second it's bad. after that convincing thought i'm like this gift ain't that bad! and set off on a journey to fuck up island.

the journey was actually quite easy and smooth sailing, did some last minute changes with the present stuff and was going to give her the present right when she got off work. (in the back of my mind it was still a bad idea). so i give her the card. i had a good laugh at least. (i told her that's all i got her.) then comes the greatest blunder... the bracelet. i handed it to her and i start to feel a vibe of awkward in me. so i kinda shake it out and gave it. after when i gave it i realized the mess i made..she started to blush.. but not the thank you blush (at least i think). it was the oh you really shouldnt have blush. realizing this i pretty much played dumb. (luckily that is easy as i am sometimes clumsy at work). when i go to the break room i slap myself... just slap myself. 

i'm really tempted to say "oh i forgot to give you this movie (being the interview)". should i do that? i realize beyond a doubt it was a shite gift. or at least she did not like the style of the bracelet or i missed some thing when i bought it that she noticed.

 

if anything is misspelled, i didn't reread only because i typed this all on my phone.

edit: fixed some misspellings now that i am on a computer. edit2 formatting and updates

**more to the story** her day seemed to go well too actually, when i got there she was happy and laughing. she asked where was the gift (as the gift is very late) and i am like in my car... she didn't believe me and in my head i was like i will give it to her at the end of break. (should of just pretended i forgot) gave it to her, and that smiling face turned into redness... yup good job me!

**i will keep you guys updated about tomorrow if you want me too** (hoping for the best!)

update: more than likely she is coming in tomorrow, ill try to play it cool... (she might interrogate me though... we will see)

**update 1: just about an hour from going into work, freaking out but sticking with the plan. also i got a million scenarios in my head but no problem... again hoping for the best and i will try to keep you guys updated at work.**  

**update 2: at work let the fun begin**

**update 3: she is not her, but being the detective me. i look at the schedule and bam she is supposed to work today... she got her friend to go instead... umm there is only one other reason why she wouldn't be here but i won't say that here. now... if her friend asks or even mentions about the gift how should i react... cause i'll just say something on the lines of yeah i fucked up.**

**update 4: so after about a week, we haven't seen each other at work. we have been off and on at texting each other (mostly off) and she called me to take her spot on sunday. that wasn't a problem. i think she is busy in her life right now, and i don't think that we are not talking to each other just because of some stupid bracelet. we are working saturday and i think sunday. i will fill you in on the news when that comes around.
overall: no real drama, but at the same time less communication... (oh by the way i did not start texting her she came to me. so i guess that is a good sign. the bracelet couldn't of possibly been worse than her finding out i liked her... nervous laugh...)**

**update 5: ok little did i know but she is working today with me and it's actually been quite alright! i walk in, and start working and i was showing no signs of awkwardness about the whole situation (yaay i did something!). we are talking yada yada yada then boom... she says something about the christmas gift (joking about it but i didnt know.) i say something krass and she was like wooooooooow and i am wearing the bracelet! she pulls her sleeve up and behold she is wearing it! my jaw drops as i am unbeliever shocked that she is actually wearing that horrible present i got. there were no words on how surprised i was. after that little squabble we get back to work because all the cars on earth decoded to come to our freaking restaurant. after the masses get their food i get sent on break. so i say all is good right now.**

**update 6: probably going to be my last update... we will see! anyways we worked today and there is no hint of awkwardness (given we worked in the morning and it was super busy, and well im not really too energetic when i have to work in the morning). still need to work on my awkwardness though, but all is well. so i guess this whole problem was just a minor thing. hooray for minor fuck ups!**

Input: Text: alright guys, this happened last night, and i can't honestly live down how bad i fucked up. but it's kind of hilarious, so enjoy.

preface: i got into an argument with my stepmother. we bicker at one another, she tells me to get out, so i take a walk.

i get the bright idea to call this girl i've been talking to, with the intent of getting completely hammered and forgetting about my problems for a night. boy was i in for a treat. the girl (we'll call her m) answers, and doesn't mind me crashing for a night, so she picks me up.

we get to her place, and everything's going fine, except that i left my e-cig in her car (this is about to become very relevant). so we're cuddling, talking about stuff, enjoying each others company and downing white russians like it's no ones business, when i get the bright idea to go to her car and grab my e-cig. she hands me the keys and says to hurry.

the fuck up: i hadn't eaten all day, and my stomach decided it was going to give me a very rude awakening. halfway down the hall to the elevator, everything goes black. after getting back in my senses as of an hour ago, apparently i:

 - blacked out in the hallway

 - woke up to the security officer asking how i got in here, who i was staying with, what was i doing laying in the middle of a hallway

 - security officer tells me to "speak english" because i started trying to speak russian (i don't speak russian at all)

 - tells me m doesn't live here (even though i just walked out of her apartment 5 minutes beforehand)

after that fiasco, he throws me in cuffs and says he's getting a patrol car. i'm out of my senses, so i tell him to go fuck himself. patrol car gets there, (and thank god i got a cool cop,) and the cop asks me if i live with my parents after running my id. i was coherent enough to say i did. he calls my dad, explains the situation, tells dad he won't charge me with drunk and disorderly if he comes and gets me (at 5am...), aaaaaaaaaaaaand i black out again.

i woke up an hour ago, in my parents house. i have no shoes because i left them at m's place, as well as my magic cards. m is being surprisingly cool about the whole ordeal, despite the fact that i have her keys still.

needless to say, i'm sticking to beer from now on.

Input: Text: this happened a few days ago. my stomach had been hurting most of the day, which is unusual, and was getting a little worse so i headed upstairs to visit the more private restroom in the house. it happened to be right around lunch time for my pudgy little cat, who i feed at my desk upstairs, so she was excited and raced upstairs as well. she was a little confused when i headed into the bathroom, but came dancing in behind me and sat in my pants while i took my time on the toilet. i finished up and as one does, i wanted to take a look at the horrid stuff that was causing me so much pain earlier, so i wiped and pulled it up for a gander. in my haste i lost my grip on the paper and like buttered toast it landed soggy side down right on the cat's back. she looked back at it, sniffed, looked up at my with eyes full of dispair, and she took off. i rushed to finish wiping, pullled up my pants and went after her. she had ripped downstairs, losing the paper in the process, then continued into the living room where she dashed into her cubby house. my mom saw her running scared and went over to check on her which involved reaching in the cubby house to pull her out. i get to the living room just in time to hear her say 'what the hell' and pull her hand up to take a whiff. mom turns around, looks me straight in the eye and says 'the cats' pooped on her own back!' in shock. it took all my might to feign confusion as i went to investigate the problem. we then cleaned the cat up with baby wipes while discussing if she needed to go the vet for suffering some sort of mental retardation.

Input: Text: i travel quite a bit for work. i spend on average 60+ nights a year in hotels, not to mention a lot of time on day trips in my car. this morning i was running late for a meeting and rushed out of my hotel without doing my daily constitutional. i was in my car finishing my 2nd cup of coffee when it hit me. i had to go. no time to turn back. i quickly go to my gps to find the nearest hotel and take the exit. 

on a side note, if you travel a lot you will find the best places to do restroom stops are hotels. always clean and private. 

i rush through the lobby like i belong there and head straight for the restroom. it's early morning so the place is pretty crowded with the breakfast crowd. i jump into the first stall i find and let out a  sigh of relief.  about halfway through i hear the door open and the clacking of shoes. the person walks into the next stall and proceeds to sit down and pee. i find this odd because men stand to pee. i glance down and notice women's shoes. i didn't notice the lack of urinals or the over abundance of stalls.  i'm in the women's restroom!

my relief turns to straight panic. here i am with my pants around my ankles and nowhere to go. i quickly lift my legs so no one can see my shoes and make out i'm a guy. i wait for her to finish, which in hindsight is quite amusing. never heard a woman blow ass like that before.  

i clean up best i can in a hurry and slowly peak over the stall to make sure i'm alone. i break for the door and run straight to the men's room to finish up and wash my hands.  i casually walk out of the men's room and run for my car. i made it.

Input: Text: on a throwaway cuz marijuana is still illegal and thats fucking dumb, anyway its my first tifu...this actually happened just now, and im still kinda fucked up. 

so reddit i have this one friend lets call her sarah. i met sarah on tinder. sarah and i started talking and what not and long story short i meet up with her on a few different occasions. these occasions usually start with alcohol and some weed. so fast forward to today and she comes over to "hang out". i show her my place (i just moved) and give her a little tour ending with the master bedroom. i then proceed to pour myself and sarah a full glass of wine (i am ~190 and she is idk a girl). we then go hang out on my couch and play ps4 for a bit while we drink our first cup. after we are done with our first full as fuck cup (she came over completely sober vs me at a 6.5) we then proceed to have another half cup of wine.

after drinking all this wine i am slightly buzzed and she is saying she is kinda drunk. i then come up with the sly move to do some dabs or better known as smoking hash oil (girls love getting high and having sex). for those people reading this that do not know what a dab (or hash oil) is think of it like this, a normal "dab" is the equivalent of smoking an entire bowl of marijuana by yourself. previously, when we were talking she told me she has never done a dab before so i want to give her a good one. 

well reddit this is where i fucked up. i am lazy and use a paperclip as my dabber (the thing you grab the dabs with), the dabs were sticky and i just couldnt get a tiny fucking dab on the paperclip so what do i do? i grab it with my man hands and try to rip off as little a dab as possible (think of like a play-dough ball but way the fuck stickier) and i pull off what i think is decent but a small dab (appropriate for a female), like it would get me decently baked. so i load that shit up for her and she hits it, and right as the "dabber" hits the nail (the thing you heat up) i see it, in all its fucking glory the great billows of smoke pouring out from my oil rig, the billows of smoke saying "you killed her".

i could see it immediately, she started coughing like she was fucking paid to do that shit. she then went in the bathroom to apparently try to calm herself the fuck down because she was dying in there. i go to knock on the door and ask if everything is alright and she said that it was worse when i talked. 

so long story short i try to do everything to calm her down and she just leaves (i did not get laid) and as i type this she is waiting for her uber, i hope she doesnt reddit but its fucking worth it for the story.
Response list: ['i tried to do a dab for my girl and she was fucking dead.']
Ground truth: killed my "date" with a huge dab after she had a few glasses worth of wine

Input: Text: i'm shaking as i type this. i'm still scared, even though i'm at home, where it's perfectly safe.

this was foreshadowed by a college visit. when trying to turn around in a stressful situation where another car was fast-approaching, she screamed at the back seat passengers to "shut the fuck up."

we were driving through a crowded city, trying to find parking so we could walk through and window shop. we turn in to a lot, and that's where the screaming begins. earlier in the day, she had threatened to punch me for doing silly things, like a too-high voice, etc. perfectly reasonable.

when we got into the lot, we couldn't find a spot, and got kind of chatty. she once again told everyone to "shut the fuck up!" she screamed it this time, at the top of her lungs. my heart felt heavy, but she was my ride, so i couldn't criticize. 

if i have 100 parallel lives, i'm pretty sure i got out of the car and called my busy parents in at least half of them.

when we were trying to get out of the lot, she screamed that if "laugh[ed] one more time [she'd] fucking punch [me]!" i'm a nervous laugher, and i'm pretty sure she knows that. she flipped off a lady who had her kid in the passenger seat. she drove over the curb instead of waiting, and kept screaming at us. my stomach tied into a knot. i think this was the point in my life where i felt the most unsafe.

my friends acted like it was a reasonable response - is it? i feel like this is going to impede my learning-how-to-drive stage. i'm going to throw up.

i've been chased by drunks, but this still took the cake.

Input: Text: this happened on friday. i work and have been at this shoe store for about 3 weeks, which i honestly don't want to disclose the name of it for safety and personal reasons.

i'm typically that guy who's quiet, although i have been working on improving that for about 2 years, so now i'm more quieter than anyone else if anything. people think i'm shy (which is severely annoying because i don't feel like im shy) but in actuality i just don't have anything to say most of the time. i can still conversate with people and whatnot, but for the most part, im just not very outspoken.

half of the entire staff vapes so in the back where we chill, vape, or work on organizing shoe boxes, there are purses, vape mods, and phones on shelves where people just leave them there. i got my own vape i am pretty content with. the fu happens around 15 minutes before closing time. there was 6-7 of us closing, including me. this girl, lets call her tina, puts her mod in her purse, closed up her purse, and walked off somewhere to talk to her relative about something. i was in the back working on organizing converses during closing time because why not, i got nothing else better to do. that's fu #1. others have came into the back for one reason or another but for the most part, i was in the back the most.

when tina was done talking on the phone, it hits closing time and she goes through her purse and notices her vape was gone. that entire 15 minutes it went missing somehow. we all thought her vape was misplaced so we had to almost turn the entire store upside down and even so we still couldn't find it. so it was ruled it was stolen or, at the very least, badly misplaced. i asked someone else if we even had cameras to find out who did it. that's fu #2. she's freaking out around that time that her $100+ mod was stolen. the co-manager was here but it got to the point where the actual manager had to come back from home to sort this thing out. the managers and tina were getting really pissed. eventually we all go home and managers say we'll figure something out tomorrow.

next day, i come back into the store because i had to exchange the shoes i bought yesterday for a bigger size. so while i'm doing that, i asked both the managers if they have found it yet. that's fu #3. they said yes, but they don't wanna talk about it because that was a doozzy, yada yada.

next day, sunday, every single person who works at the shoe store is required to come to a mandatory meeting about sales, black friday, and the such. it was best for everyone to come to the store early. so i came in early and saw tina. already knowing the answer but just wanting to make conversation with her, i was telling her so i heard that it has been found and that's good to hear. still the fu #3. she quickly says "yes, and i know who did it" without looking me in the eye. i thought "okaaay...". everyone who is seasonal and were hired like 3-5 weeks ago were evaluated in the back while the meeting was happening at the sales floor. it was my turn. the manager and some veteran staff including tina, staff who's been at the shoe store for a very long time, were present. i was told im doing a fantastic job sorting converses, but need to be more vocal on the floor, and the such.

but then after all that, they pretty much dropped the bomb and tell me i am the prime suspect who went through her purse, took her vape, and stuck it in a box of timberlands that was put up on the timberlands shelf. the guy who i asked if we had cameras told them i asked them that. another guy claims i was around the timberlands, although i was near converses the entire time working on rearranging the shoes. tina think it's suspicious that i keep asking if it has been found and that i am the only one who's been asking that. not even her best friend asked her anything about the vape. i keep telling them and looking them dead in the eye that i never went through her purse and took her damn vape. only the manager said that if i can look him dead in the eye and swear i didn't do it then he believes me. but if new evidence shows up, i am terminated. i'm still in shock that all of that happens. now almost everyone is convinced that i am the one who did it without solid concrete evidence.

 
edit: formatting and adding additional details.
Response list: ['i was in the back of the store, i got my vape stolen.']
Ground truth: i got accused of going through someones purse, taking their vape, and sticking it in a box of shoes, and asking if we had cameras and asking if it has been found yet has made me the prime suspect.

Input: Text: this happened a few years ago.

my ex wife and i went out drinking and i got blackout drunk. i made the piss poor decision to attempt to drive home. i barely remember fishtailing my car when my ex screamed at me to get out and let her drive. 

we were driving home and i remember driving home with her screaming at me when my genius drunk self told her "well just let me out of the car!" apparently she did. next thing i remember i woke up on the side of the road face down in a ditch. 

i attempted to stumble home and barely remember falling down the hill on the side of the road several times. i finally made it home (which i later measured was over 2 miles). 

when i got home i realized i had no keys and no garage door opener. so i started banging on the door for my ex wife to open the door. i don't remember how long i was banging on the door, and i don't even remember my ex wife opening the door, but i remember falling off the front step of my house into a bush. 

the next morning i woke up, hung over as fuck, and couldn't figure out why my feet hurt so badly. as i lay there, feet throbbing, i felt like my back was itchy. so i rolled over and instantly regretted thst decision. it felt like i was being stung by hundreds of bees at the same time. 

after talking to my ex wife i realized she had kicked me out of the car almost 4 miles from home because i "told her to". while walking home i lost one of my flip flops and fell down the hill on the side of the road several times. after finally making it back home i was banging on the door and fell backwards into a barberry bush. which of you don't know what that is, is a bush with red leaves and thorns. the next morning my ex spent 2 hours with tweezers pulling thorns out of my back.

Input: Text: this actually happened last summer, but being somewhat new to this subreddit i decided to share my wonderful fu with you all. a little bit o' info about me and my so; me and my girlfriend both lived in separate houses. she was 17 and i was 18. we couldn't have sex at her house because her parents watched us like a hawk, not to mention she always had little siblings running into her room. we also couldn't have sex in my room because i shared the basement with my dad, only being separated by a thin wall. both of us newly discovered the life of sex and the great things it hold, so you can only imagine how horny we were 24/7.

 it was approximately 11 p.m. on a saturday night and both of our *"need to have sex"* levels were running high. so without hesitating we jumped in the car and drove a couple of blocks to the nearest park. the parking lot, i so wisely chose, was about 500 feet from any houses and overlooked the city where you could see many bright lights, kinda romantic actually. it belonged to some musical theater or something, i honestly didn't care at the time i just wanted to do the horizontal mombo, if ya catch my drift. anyways, what i didn't notice was that there was construction equipment that wasn't being used in said parking lot. after we pull in and park, we turn the car off and start going at it. we were taking each others clothes off and trying to get into some sort of position in my tiny 2001 toyota corolla (let me tell you, that is a *fucking* mission. literally.) i was facing the back of the car looking towards the entrance of the parking lot, and at this point i was so hyped up and both of our adrenaline was running. then it came... not me err, but a car did. very suddenly and quickly, a car pulled up behind us and just stopped. lights flashing behind us and the sounds of doors opening we both start panicking. at this point i don't remember what was said, i just remember a lot of "shit, shit, shit" and "holy fucking shit that is a cop." and "where the fuck are my pants??" of course they sit there for a little bit, probably waiting for us to get our clothes on or whatever, and i can't find my fucking pants. like had no idea where they were. so the cops, (yes there were two) gets to the window, and we are both sitting in the front. i still couldn't find my pants so i have nothing but a shirt over my crotch and my heart is racing rapidly at this point. like it seriously was the worst de-boner ever. total cockblock. ugh. anyway, the cop on my side, who was female, says to me "sooooooo what are you two up to tonight?" then the cops asked for our i.d.s and before she walked away she said, "why don't you put some pants on it's a little chilly out here." we were both really freaking out at this point, imagining explaining this to our parents. especially her parents because technically she shouldn't even be dating, nor did they know i was dating her. the cops come back, tell us that both our records are clean, and they tell us that some lady across the street saw us pull in. and she called the cops because she thought we were going to mess with some goddamn construction equipment. **like seriously**?? construction equipment was the last thing on my damn mind. i had half a mind to find out where she lived, waited till i heard her having sex, then bust in her room and totally kill the mood. well anyway, luckily we were only given a warning and they didn't contact either of our parents. they just told us not to come back there ever again and said that we were trespassing. like, they really didn't have to tell us not to come back. *don't worry officer, we'll do it at home next time* i had the worst blue balls after that, and needless to say we won't be having sex in a car anytime soon... or ever.

so my sister bought a tiny pepper spray bottle that you can put on your keychain for easy access. as a younger and curious kid, the concept of pepper spray interested me and i wondered what these things could really do. so while we were sitting in church i was playing with my sister's set of keys during the sermon. i fiddled around with the pepper spray bottle and eventually, sprayed an area a little under the chair in front of me for a tiny second. nothing happened, and i think i was expecting nothing to happen. my younger mind must have thought it was like opening a switchblade and thought nobody would get hurt if i didn't actually use it directly on them. i was horribly wrong. after maybe thirty seconds some people sitting near the center of the church started coughing a little, then a lot. i was coughing a little too, but they were wheezing. my sister starts to notice this and looks at what's in my hand, the pepper spray bottle. she yanks me by the shirt collar and angrily yet quietly said: "did you use the pepper spray?" i nodded my head in fear. she gives me a purple nurple and i almost screamed out during the sermon. "look up you idiot" she said. i looked towards the ceiling and saw that we were sitting right under a big air conditioner. which was aiming right at the coughing people. she forced me to apologize to all of them, one of my teachers who was caught by the pepper spray was quick to forgive saying "that was the greatest prank i have ever seen!"

 so the next day i go to the executive chef to talk to him about giving him a reward or something (something our hotel does to keep moral up), the issue was, the executive chef had no idea who the guy was, and thus investigated it turned out  he was a friend of the department manager and was off the books. this guy has a wife and 4 kids and now no job because i tried to reward him for his hard work.

Input: Text: to kick things off, let me say that this fuck up did not occur today, but when i was 15 (i'm 19 now).  

i got my first job when i was 14 as a bagger at a local grocery store chain.  i still work there (though no longer a bagger, i've moved up to a supervisor position) when i come back home for breaks from college.  because of my age, i wasn't old enough to drive to work at the time so i would get rides from either my parents or my older sister most of the time.  however, this time was different.  

it was a nice summer day.  i got a ride to work from my dad, but he had to be at a meeting that evening so he couldn't pick me up.  both my mom and older sister were out of town.  so i had to plan on walking four miles home that evening, kind of shitty but not a big deal.  there's a chipotle right across the street from my job, i was hungry.  got off work, bought a chicken burrito and decided to eat it on the walk home.  

as i'm walking home eating this burrito, i started to not feel so hot.  my stomach and i both knew that some shit wasn't right.  as i was nearing the end of this burrito, there was just a barrage of flatulence making its way into the world.  the surrounding ten feet could've been declared a biohazard.  you know in those creepy old elementary school bus safety videos where they talk about the "danger zone"?  think of it like that.  i was not feeling good.  at this point in my walk home though, for the next two miles or so there was nowhere to stop in case i had to answer the call of nature and take a dump.  i could feel it brewing, but i thought i'd be able to make it home in time.  i kept walking.

but the pressure.  oh man.  the pressure in my stomach had begun to assume its authority over me.  i was a little less than two miles away from home at the point when i realized "oh fuck, i don't know how much longer i can keep this in."  i kept it in though for much longer than i thought i'd be able to.  you know that feeling when you're like "oh my god, seriously i'm gonna shit myself right now if i don't get to a toilet in the next 8 seconds"?  i kept it in with that feeling for about another 20 minutes.  i was actually surprised at how long i was able to last in that degree of discomfort.

i was about a mile away from home (keep in mind i've been walking this entire time - running was not an option with my physical state.  i even had to stop walking a few times to take a break when the discomfort got too real).  then it happened.  it was a total 100% involuntary release.  my body could take no more.  a deep mud came ripping out of my ass.  as this assault to my work pants and boxers was committing i let out the most surrendering "ohhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuuuuuck" i've ever let out.  you know that scene in platoon when sgt. elias dies?  it was like that (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkpqb3bepbi skip to 2:33 for the part i'm alluding to).  i had to keep my hand on my ass and my gooch to literally hold the shit in place to prevent it from running down my legs.  i still had about a mile to go.

as i'm walking home in this state of deep embarrassment yet laughter because of how ridiculous this had become, a car driving in my neighborhood stops and the female driver rolls down her window and asks if i'm alright and if i need a ride.  i was walking quite awkwardly with my hand pressed against my ass in a very dedicated manner, so i guess i admire her sense of concern?  i politely decline, and say that i'm almost home and that i just slipped and fell and i'll be fine.  i would've loved to accept that ride, but did i really want to knock her out with the rancid smell of the remnants of that chipotle burrito?  did i really want to ruin her leather interior with a long-lost jackson pollock brown masterpiece?  no, not really.  

i made it home, threw away my pants and boxers, ran up to the bathroom to finish the job.  i called my mom while i was still sitting on the toilet, just laughing my ass off at the recent events and said "mom, you're not gonna believe what just happened to me."
Response list: ['i got a chicken burrito and shit myself.']
Ground truth: i was 15 years old, had to walk four miles home from work, thought it would be a good idea to eat a chipotle burrito on the go and wound up shitting myself, having to walk almost an entire mile with nothing but shit in my pants.

Input: Text: this probably won't be what you were expecting, considering this didn't actually happen today, it happened in elementary school, and does not involve sex, but it's cringe worthy nonetheless (in my opinion). 

one morning i woke up and got dressed, everything was normal. i had my favourite pair of flare jeans on (they were all the rage), but unfortunately it was winter so i had to tuck them into my boots. i didn't notice anything wrong. i didn't notice the extra pair of undies stuck in my pant leg. i guess they had gotten stuck in there during the wash, and somehow i couldn't feel it. so anyway, i went to school and changed into my indoor shoes. my indoor shoes didn't require me to tuck in the flare so that opened the shoot for my underpants to fall out, only they didn't fall out right away, and i still didn't notice them. i guess it took me walking around a bit for them to slowly slide down my leg. yet still i didn't feel it.

 i sat at the front of the class and when the teacher started teaching, i guess thats when they finally fell out. i was still oblivious. who knows how long they were there for, just sitting under my desk. so anyway, my teacher finishes the lesson and gives us time to work on stuff or fill out a sheet or something, i don't remember what. suddenly the teacher comes over to me. now this teacher was the coolest teacher in the school according to everybody, and me being a teachers pet, i thought for sure something good was gonna happen. maybe i would get to be the chalkboard cleaner for the day? or take the attendance down to the office? oh how i wish it was one of those things, but no. she came over to my desk and in a low voice said "i think you dropped something under your desk" then quickly walked away. thank god she didn't draw any attention to me. i looked under my desk and sure enough there were my orange and red flowered underwear. i briefly wondered how they got there, quickly grabbed them, balled them in my hand so nobody could tell what i was holding and ran out of the class. i went to my locker and quickly shoved them in my backpack and came back to class, sure my red face would give me away. nobody said anything though. either i was oblivious to people noticing or i truly got away with it. to this day i'm still not sure. 

i still get very awkward when i see the teacher around. she's the only one that knows and she probably remembers the incident better than i do because i was young. sometimes my friends and i will visit our old elementary school and drop in to some of our favourite teachers classes. since she was a favourite they always want to visit her, but at all costs i always try to avoid it.

Input: ["As I'm sure you know, Turkey is a potential threat to us both. I'd like to talk to you about possibly curtailing that threat.", "I can't be online but I am open to hearing your ideas", '*** online too much longer is what I meant to type', "Well, the ideas mostly consist of cooperating to take them down, you, me, and the Italians. I'm going to be moving from Warsaw to Ukraine to take Romania and I'm going to be bouncing them in the Black Sea.", 'so. I am open to working with you.. but I would like to see you leave Gal as a neutral territory and I will as well']
Response list: ["I think I'm going to be moving from Warsaw to Ukraine to take Romania and I'm going to be bouncing them in the Black Sea."]

Input: ["Greetings, Austria!\n\nWe don't have any immediate discussion points, but thought I would check in with you since it can be dangerous for me if Austria collapses early, and that is a serious risk if Austria is a newbie (not sure if you are).\n\nSuggest that you get Germany on your side early. They will be dangerously exposed if you struggle early. You should ask them to send F Kiel - Denmark with the message to Russia that if he attacks you (with A Warsaw - Galicia instead of Ukraine), he will block them out of Sweden.\n\nGood luck, and have fun!", 'Greetings to you as well.  I wish you luck and I will certainly keep all of that in mind', 'Seems like year one went well for you! Have both Greece and Serbia in the bag! How are your feelings on Italy?', 'I am friendly with them thus far.  I am open to discussion in general about how we might be able to work together.', "Haha I'm sure Turkey would be very alarmed to hear that"]

Input: ['Greetings, Germany!\n\nThe risk of an early conflict between France and Germany is pretty high, so suggest that we clear the air early on.\n\nThe biggest question here is Burgundy, which borders one of your home supply centers and two of mine. It is important to me that Burgundy remains unoccupied - my suggestion is that we set up a bounce between A Munich - Burgundy, A Paris - Burgundy. This has the secondary benefit of allowing us to put on some theater about how the other broke their word to win sympathy points. I also believe that Germany often wants A Munich to stay put anyways, to guard against an attack through Tyrolia.\n\nLet me also know your thoughts regarding Belgium. I am not super attached to claiming it, so would be open to bargain my support on the Belgian question for a future alliance.\n\nBest of luck to you!', 'Hi France! Thanks for taking the initiative and for your thoughtful message. Let’s do the bounce in Burgundy! I’m really looking forward to getting to know you and everyone in this game!', 'Appreciated. What are your thoughts on F Kiel to Denmark vs Netherlands? Assuming Berlin to Kiel is a typical no brainer', 'I’m going to Hol, if that’s alright with you? I’m very interested in your idea of giving me free pass into Belgium for an alliance against England.', "I would have preferred a move to Denmark, but Holland isn't a problem for me either - it's up to you."]
Response list: ["I think I'm going to go with Denmark, but I'm not sure if you agree."]
Ground truth: Are you aiming to claim Belgium in year 1? As it is, there's no way for you to get three builds so curious which two you will prioritize.

Obviously England and Germany are more immediate concerns for me (as are Austria and Russia for you). But neither of us wants to see Italy expand too far, and it would be of mutual benefit to share any information that we hear about them.', "On a related note, have you heard from Russia or Austria? I'm curious to see if Russia plans to send A Moscow north or south."]
Response list: ["I don't know much about Russia, but I've heard that they're going to send a large army to the south, and I'm going to send a small army to the north."]

Hopefully you feel the same way. Anyways, good luck and have fun!', "Always good to discuss things in advance to avoid unnecessary nonsense. I'm not particularly interested in Norway so long as you're not interested in Sweden.", 'Sounds good', 'That was a hell of a bluff you must have pulled to put that army in the Netherlands', 'Thanks 😊.']

I'll definitely see what I can do, a big Russia is just as bad for me as everyone else", 'Sweet!', "I was talking with Russia, negotiating over Norway and such. They told me they were planning on attacking you, as they thought I was there ally. The truth is, I really don't want to see russia run off with this game, so I decided to let you know."]

Input: ['Hi there! I figured it would be good to open up talks between us, what’re your initial thoughts? I plan on playing rather conservatively until I see how some alliances are shaking out.', "Same on my end to be honest; first game I've ever played with any money on the line lol", "hm, if you're okay starting conservatively, could I make the ask that you start by opening to Tyn or move to take Tun with a fleet?", 'I’d still plan on moving into ION, it gives me more options.', 'Yea, I have no issue with Ion in and of itself ~~ id just rather not see you also setting up a Lepanto by prepping a convoy to Tun :p']
Response list: ["Okay, I'm going to go with Lepanto for now. I'm going to take Tun and then move to ION."]
Ground truth: If you reeeally want to try a Lepanto, we can go for it lol, but I think we'd stall out a bit too much to make it worthwhile

Input: ['Hi there! I think us attacking each other early game is pretty dumb, what’re your thoughts?', "I agree. Even with the element of surprise, it's just too easy to defend the Piedmont/Marseilles corridor.\n\nIf France attacks Italy, it will most likely be Austria who benefits, and likewise if Italy attacks France the spoils probably go to Germany.\n\nGiven that, what are your plans? Are you planning to attack Austria early, or thinking of the standard move of: \nF Naples - Ionian\nA Rome - Naples\nA Venice H", 'Yeah I’m not planning on going for Austria off the bat, I feel like it usually just locks the two weakest countries into a fight that hurts us both', 'Understood, good to know!', 'Seems like everything went pretty much according to plan. Not sure why Turkey stayed in Smy instead of backfilling to Con. Seems a bit passive to me.']
Response list: ["I think I'm going to go for the standard move of Naples - Rome - Venice"]
Ground truth: He’s scared of me pulling off a lepanto. What’s the deal for you guys, seems like you and england have an agreement at the very least to stay out of ENG. Did you and germany agree to that bounce in Bur?

Input: ['Hey France 😁. I would like to suggest an alliance between the two of us, against Germany. In my opinion a England-France alliance is super powerful, especially if we can trust each other. Germany has reached out to me about an alliance to attack you, but franly I think France as a country is a much more powerful ally.To start I suggest we have the English Channel as a DMZ and coordinate and attack on Germany. Anyways good luck and have fun!', "Dear England,\nI completely agree that the French-English alliance can be quite powerful. Naturally, the main sticking point early on is whether we can trust each other to demilitarize the Channel.\nOn my end, I have little reason to go there unless I distrust you. I plan to go to Mid-Atlantic, which would allow me to move to Spain (south coast) and establish an early presence in the Mediterranean. Will also aim to get into Burgundy, where I can potentially support you into Belgium.\nMy suggestion is that you open with:\nF Edinburgh - Norwegian Sea\nF London - North Sea \nA Liverpool - Yorkshire\nThis guarrenteed you a build in Norway even if Russia moves A Moscow north, while potentially letting you convoy into Belgium. And you can be safe in the knowledge that either A Yorkshire or F North Sea can cover London in the event that I don't keep my word.\nLet me know your thoughts. Good luck to you as well!", 'Sounds good!', 'How are your relations with Germany?', 'Getting into burgundy would be great. I’ll work some magic with Germany and try to get them to not move there.']
Response list: ['I think I’ll go with the English Channel as a DMZ and coordinate with you.']
Ground truth: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

I think I meant France or Austria?']
Response list: ['I think I meant Austria or France.']

Input: ["Good evening. I think it's important that we get our affairs in order regarding Sweden; I'm sure you know that you can easily bounce me to keep me out, but I'd like to convince you otherwise. Let me know if there's anything specific you'd like in return, otherwise I think that assistance against possible English attack and an agreement to leave Warsaw, Silesia, and Prussia alone is good.", 'Hi Russia! Thanks for reaching out. I’m open to an arrangement similar to those terms (neutrality in Pru, Sil, War, Boh if that comes up, as well as and really especially potential assistance against England). I would also like your support into Nwy down the road. I think splitting Scandinavia is reasonable and that takes pressure off of me to look to War as a future build. How does that sound to you? Looking forward to a fun and exciting game!', "I'd prefer for us to cooperate to take the British down completely; I get Norway, you get as many British home territories as you can convince the French to let you have. Aside from that, those neutral zones sound good to me.", 'I’m not sure I’m ready to just hand over Norway and Sweden, unfortunately:/', "You'll get Norway then."]
Response list: ["I think that's a good move."]
Ground truth: Sounds good to me! Thank you so much for being agreeable. I view Norway as a gesture of goodwill and I will definitely remember it. Hopefully, I will find another way to help you in the future 😃

Input: ["Greetings, Russia!\n\nWe don't have too much to discuss early on, but I was curious on whether or not you were planning to move A Moscow - St Petersburg, where you could make a play for Norway.\n\nAnd likewise, was curious whether you planned to order F Sevestapol - Black Sea, or else allow Turkey to occupy it.\n\nIt's early, but we might have room to cooperate against England or Germany in the future. Let's keep in touch. Good luck.", "I'd be very interested in organizing a group effort against Britain right now. I likely won't move to Saint Petersburg the first turn in case the Germans try something but I'm definitely bouncing in the Black sea.", "Understood, what's your plan then? \n\nYou might consider Moscow to Livonia, which would still improve your situation in the north (since you could convoy to Sweden and then build in StP), while also helping to cover Warsaw.\n\nOr else you could just commit both of your armies to the south.", "I've spoken with the Germans, and a group effort against the British is likely. I'm still considering various ways to secure my position better, but I think keeping one army put in Moscow offers the best stability for the time being; If the Germans are telling the truth it will likely move to secure a spot in Finland in the second year.", "I would advise against staying put. Both Ukraine and Livonia can defend 3/4 of your centers. St Petersburg  can't be attacked year 1 and the risk to Sevestapol is nominal in year 1, since even if he goes all out you bounce him out of Black Sea and he can only make an unsupported attempt from Armenia"]
Response list: ["I'm going to move to St Petersburg and then move to Black Sea. I'm going to move to Sevestapol and then move to Black Sea."]
Ground truth: Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North

Input: ['Hey Italy, just saying high. I doubt we will cross paths until later in the game, but if you feel so inclined you could attack France 😉. France is probably the strongest county and I think me, you, and Germany should shut them down before they can get up and running. Anyways, good luck and have fun!', 'Thanks for reaching out! Yeah as Italy I will have to feel the board out before making any commitments.', 'Of course', 'Things are looking pretty peaceful in the west!', 'I would have thought France would have gone army in Bre and fleet in Mar, do you know why he flipped them?']
Response list: ['I think I know why France flipped them. He was going to go to Bre and Mar, but then he went to Bre and Mar and then went to Bre and Mar again.']
Ground truth: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you

Instruction: In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text. Your task is to generate a short summary for this text. The summary must include a situation which caused humor. The summary should be one or two sentences long.
Input: Text: i also have skype log with the friend who i mention in this post and if people are interested i will share it.

ok around 2 years ago the night before my high school graduation i couldn't sleep because i was full of adrenaline. my friend who is insomniac who lives in california was talking to me. now at the time i was really really really tired so i started acting like i was high. or at least what i think it's like to be high. i'm talking to my friend and i look outside my window and i see bunnies. i don't know why but these bunnies are so fascinating to me and i seriously want to share this with my friend. i told him all about it and i tried to get a picture of the bunnies but i couldnt. so then i got the bright idea of going outside at about 6 o'clock in the morning and trying to take a picture of these bunnies. so i'm finally outside and i can't find the bunnies because they're hiding in the bush or some shit. i'm pretty bummed out but then i turn around and realize that i locked myself out of my house. normally this wouldn't be a problem because i would have people at home and i would just call them but my mom was in italy so no one was at home. my aunt would come around during the day to make sure everything was okay but she wasn't staying with me at night. now here's the part that really sucks. the day before we had graduation rehearsal. the principal told us that we need to bring certain papers with us or we wouldn't be able to graduate. and guess what? my papers were inside the house. i was going to have to redo my senior year if i couldnt get inside.  because i wanted to take pictures of fucking bunnies for my friend on the internet. i tell my friend (i still have wifi) and he's literally unable to type to me because he's laughing so hard. i have no fucking idea what to do. my friend tells me i should break a window. i have nothing to break a window with. i guess i could push it but then i would probably get pretty fucked up and wouldnt be able to go to my graduation. also my mom would probably get pretty mad at me. so then i decide ok i have no choice. i'm breaking into my god damn neighbors house. i remember that when i was a kid my mom gave my neighbor a key to my house. i walk over to my neighbors house and thank god the door was fucking unlocked. i remember where the key was when i was a kid and i take it. i go back to my house. it doesn't work.  at this point i'm actually crying and i'm so mad that i can barely keep it together. i'm really over tired and my mental state is fucking terrible. i remember seeing one more key near the key that i took. i decided that it's worth a shot and i go back and get the key. and praise the fucking sun of actually worked. to this day whenever i see those bunnies in my yard i am incredibly scared and anxious.
Response list: ["i broke into my neighbor's house to take pictures of bunnies and now i'm scared of them."]
Ground truth: saw bunnies outside at six in the morning. wanted to take a picture for my friend. locked myself out of the house. didn't have a key. mom was in italy. stole key from neighbors house. almost missed graduation.

Instruction: In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text. Your task is to generate a short summary for this text. The summary must include a situation which caused humor. The summary should be one or two sentences long.
Input: Text: it happened last year. i was 29. never, until that day, had i broken a bone in my body. i was pretty proud of that; but pride comes before destruction.

my wifey had arranged a surprise trip up to visit a college friend and his family. we'd studied together during my exchange year in the us, and we became great friends. we've since had kids, got jobs; you know - done life.

things didn't start off great as, on the morning we left, my oldest (2 at the time) wasn't feeling great. we thought nothing of it. nothing of the fact that we had been hanging around with one of his mates who was pretty sick the day before. that turned into what we now affectionately refer to as the plague. the plague that got my other kiddo, their three kids, and one of them, violently sick. but that's another story for another time.

my friend and i wanted to go to the local park and visit his nearest pokèstop. who wouldn't?

we had a fixed gear bike and a skateboard between us - he'd left his longboard at work, and while i was really looking forward to using it, i figured we'd switch out and take turns on these other modes of transportation.

it's here that i'll say that a skateboard, to me, was only ever a means of transportation. my best mate and his brother loved going down to the park or cruising through town looking for ledges and steps. not me. i always wanted a longboard, but a skateboard did the job. a to b. home to college, college to town, etc. as long as it was flat, i was happy.
i'll also mention that using someone else's skateboard is rather like borrowing their car. sure, you know the fundamentals - how to direct it, slow it, generally maneuver it - but it will always feel... off... not quite your own. not quite comfortable. their trucks will be tighter, their bearings faster; the deck will be curved a little more, and the wheels a bit harder. so many things to fight against.

we set off one the first day with no problem. i rode the bike, he held the seat. three blocks there, three back. easy!

the second day, i rode there again. we decided that i'd ride the skateboard back and he'd cycle. bad decision number 1.

a block and a half down, we were making some pretty good speed. i was loving the feeling of pavement under my wheels again! but as we hit a new stretch of asphalt, i bumped and tensed up a little. major speed wobble. my stomach knotted.
i let go of the bike and ran the board down. no incident. ... so i got back on. bad decision number 2.

we set off again and built up some more speed. his house was just on the other side of the apex of a small hill, so as we approached, i saw that there was a little downhill stint before his driveway. we had some fair speed, so i didn't want to hit that hill - i mean, speed wobble going down that would be terrible!
again, the bike was a fixed gear, so all i needed to do was hold on until he had slowed down in his driveway, then i could dismount and we could carry on with the day. rent a movie, get some barbecue.

but no. i made bad decision number 3. i let go of the bike in order to avoid the hill.
with good speed, i carved to the side of the road to stop. i ride regular, so with my left foot planted firmly over the front trucks, i slid my right foot off the back and brought it forward to drag on the road and slow me down.
cue the most intense speed wobble of my life as i tense up on one foot, board going mental, headed towards a curb.

as i fall, i do what i did through high school rugby - tuck up, lead with the shoulder.

my knee hits first. tears a perfect square out of my favourite jeans. then my side, as i acquire an odd, uniformly rectangle-shaped road rash. my upper arm and shoulder hit with a crunch, the top of my head thuds down just shy of the curb.

i know something's up but there is no pain. none.

i rise to my feet and i mentally assess what's just gone on.

then i move my left arm forward at the shoulder. it "shlucks" forward way too easy. and pops back unnaturally. i do it two or three times.

"mate," i said, "i think this is dislocated."

i reach up with my right hand to feel a massive bump where my usually bumpless clavicle sits.

"oh, definitely broken," i almost chuckle.

what followed was a cocktail of ambulance rides, staying very still, sleeping very little, and working... not so much. i saw a doctor eight days after doing this and he said that if i didn't have the frame i did, it wouldn't have surprised him if the bone had split clean through my shoulder.
he scheduled me for surgery the next day. miraculously, it hadn't broken through the membrane around the bone itself, so all three pieces of my completely demolished collar bone were as cooperative as they could be for the strip of metal that my body now hosts.

my first broken bone. go big or go home, right?

i missed some work before the surgery, and a good few days afterwards. ate through my sick leave, personal days, and then some. cut two of my paycheques in half (and as the sole income for my family of four, that stung a little). missed enough work to disqualify me from my bonus. all the while i needed help getting dressed, needed to be driven everywhere, and couldn't hug my wifey or my boys.

i shouldn't have let go of that bike.
Response list: ['i let go of my bike, let go of my friend, let go of my life.']
Ground truth: got on skateboard well, got off it not so well. broke things. missed lots of work, family time and self-dependence.

Input: Text: i work in it and this all started a week or so ago by me backing up the archived company data. we have tons of archived data and i have spent weeks moving the files to external hard drives and removing the data from our main storage. finish most of the work and set the drives aside for the head guy to later take them home or what ever the company plans to do with the data. 

a couple of weeks go by and the company is determined to buy new storage but cheaply. they want to add space to alleviate the ever increasing amount by buying a home use data storage unit. cool, i guess, but not really a professional box. we have a little trouble getting it connected to the main network and the head man in charge comes down to help us as he working in that field for a long time. he asks why we did not fill up the box with hard drives like he asked and i replied that the box only needed two drives to start it up and we can add more as time went on. he tells me to add more drives and without really thinking i grabbed the backup drives and loaded them into the new box. one hour goes by and i realize what i had done. i pull the drives out of the unit and realize that all of the data had been formatted over. fuck. i tried using easus to get the data off but when i did nothing is really readable.
Response list: ['i backed up data and added more drives to a new storage unit. the data was formatted over.']
Ground truth: i used archived drives to fill up a new storage box overwriting years of company data and costing thousands.

Input: Text: so about 5 years ago, my 12-year-old self and my family were driving back from a holiday in tasmania(large island below australian mainland) and stopped off at my cousins place halfway between tasmania and home.
we stayed there for a few days just to rest and catch up as we hadn't seen them for ages. on the last day before we left i had the ingenious idea of playing g hide and seek in their large backyard.
so the game had been going for quite a while when it was my brothers turn to count. i quickly decided that the best thing to do would be to climb a medium sized tree and hide within the branches. due to my plan being quite stupid my brother discovered me in around three seconds.
after that i was annoyed so as i jumped down from the tree (2-3 metres can't really remember) i didn't look where i would landed and ended up with my leg being sliced through by an ancient rusty star picket that someone had left below the tree.

at first i didn't realise and began to walk forward. i was confused as to why everyone had such strange looks on their faces and why they all rushed over. it was only then that i collapsed onto my face as my leg couldn't take my weight.

so it turned out that the pole and sliced right up through my leg leaving a massive, deep bloody gash that encompassed from my ankle to my knee.
the worst part was the my parents didn't even care so we got in our car and began the 10 hour drive home. well, they didn't care until it got infected that is.
Response list: ["my brother was playing hide and seek in my cousin's backyard and i was the one who got sliced through by a rusty star picket."]
Ground truth: when i was younger we went to stay at cousins house. we were playing a game when i jumped out of a tree onto an old rusty spike which went right up my leg, infecting it and leaving me with a huge scar to this day.

Input: Text: ok this happened 10 days ago when i ordered the ipad pro online, to be delivered by ups.  

last monday, i went to ups to pick up the package.  to my dismay, they declared the package was lost and asked me to contact apple.  

**day 1, 12/1**.  contacted apple cs.  they told me a replacement order will be sent to me, by 12/5 saturday (yesterday), because i need the ipad pro for a business trip.  the rep reassured me this will not be a problem, and that within 24 hours, i will get an email with the replacement order.  (so far so good)

**next day, 12/2.**  contacted apple cs chat again since no replacement order was sent.  the rep again assured me that it will happen in 24 hours, and then they can overnight the ipad pro to me by friday so that i can make my trip w/ it (ok....)

**12/3** got replacement order, but the delivery date shows 10 days from then, not overnight.  contacted cs because this will be long past my trip.  at this time, the ipad is finally in stock so i offered to pick it up in person.  i can finally get my ipad before the trip and happy holiday to me, right?  not according to apple cs rep:

"can you escalate the order so that i can get it overnight?" "nope"
"can someone from store overnight the ipad to me?" "our system doesn't talk to the store"
"ok, then can you change the replacement order to store pick up?" "our system doesn't talk to the store".  

wut!?  the customer tried to make it easy for the team by offering to drive 30 minutes to the store to pick up an item that's currently in stock, but you do not allow him to do so.  but wait, there's "one more thing".

according to the rep, the best solution is to cancel the replacement order and repurchase the item from the store.  

"ok.  but i ordered the item via a gift card.  will i get the refund fast enough so i can use the proceed immediately?  i need the ipad in 2 days you know?"
"yes the gift card will be there in 24 hours and the credit card portion will take 3-5 days to show up".
"ok then!"

**12/4.** replacement order cancelled, but still no gift card refund.  contacted cs and again he assured me i will get a new gift card email in 24 hours *(lies!)*

**12/5 (yesterday)** still no refund.  cs says it's in processed, and it will take 3-5 days. *(wut!?  after repeatedly promised that i will get the ipad by today for my business trip, the best answer i get is it's in process!?  if i knew i wouldn't have fucked up and cancel the replacement order in the first place!)*

**12/6 (just now)**:  called cs.  same answer, and bonus point they hanged up on me.  *(i think i have been blacklisted by apple.) *

obviously this has been a super frustrating experience.  the worse fuck up part of this is, apple doesn't have to fix any of these.  reality is no matter what the outcome, i would still buy the ipad pro, and that chances are when they release the ipad pro 2, 3, 4..., i will still buy them.  the situation is that fucked up!  

**ps:**  apple cs really sucks...maybe even worse than at&t's and comcast's.  at least a&t and comcast would be openly rude to you.  apple cs pretends to treat you nice and lies to you instead, so that they can get a favorable cs review.

Instruction: In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text. Your task is to generate a short summary for this text. The summary must include a situation which caused humor. The summary should be one or two sentences long.
Input: Text: so, this didn't happen today, it happened in december 2014.

my grandmother had passed away and we needed a burial plot to put her in. 
now, i'm from a tiny island, where there isn't a lot of space, so the plots in the ground are very expensive. most people put their dearly departed in these "coffin condos" and even those aren't cheap. i'm not sure what the term is, but they're these huge buildings made from concrete that go about 4 plots high and maybe 10 plots wide. if i find a picture of this i will post it in the comments.

so, as i said, there's not a lot of space and plots are expensive, so often families will have up to 3 of their deceased "share" a plot. this is possible when a lot of years go by between the deaths and the bodies have decomposed sufficiently, so the remains can be removed from their original coffin, be put into a much smaller box, so that then there is room for the new coffin. 

what they do is pretty gruesome if you think too much about it.
they open the plot, take out the coffin, open the coffin and "break down" the remains of the deceased into smaller "pieces" to fit in the smaller box and also clean up the plot for the new coffin.

now, when a plot of a deceased is opened to make room for a new coffin, it is mandatory that a family member be present to check that everything is in order. (i think the funeral home demands this to make sure that the family later can't accuse the funeral home employees of robbing the deceased's plot).

so, in this case that lucky family member was me. my grandmother had no close remaining relatives, my mother had died in march and had been my grandma's only remaining child, my dad was no help, so the care of the plots now fell to me. 

the plot my grandma was going into was that of her foster-father. this man died about 20 years before i was born, so it suffices to say that i didn't know the man. heck, i had never even seen a picture of him. still, i was the one that had to "supervise" his transfer to a smaller coffin.

so, there i was the day of the transfer and i was close to losing my shit. 2014 had not been good to me; my mom died in march, then my grandma died in december right before christmas and now here i was about to see my first skeleton. sure i'd seen dead bodies before, but never in that state of decomposition. i was pretty sure i was going to faint that day. my dad had come with me, but being the big hero he is, he was walking around somewhere between the plots and was no support to me. 

the cemetery caretakers show up and start opening the plot, all while i'm wondering when my nerves are going to get the best of me and i end up going night night. i look around where i'm standing to make sure that if i do faint, that there's some soft grass to land in. to my surprise i make it to the point where the coffin is taken out of the plot and the caretakers are waiting for my permission to open the casket.

i give the go ahead and there he is; my great-grandfather. it was like a skeleton wearing a pale blond wig and an old dusty blue suit. i could even see his dentures still sitting in what was left of his jaw. 

at this point curiosity is getting the best of me and i'm slowly inching my way closer and closer to the coffin trying to get a better look. i get up all to way to the coffin and take a closer look at what once was a living, breathing person. it was an odd experience to see what we end up as. 

as i'm dealing with all that i'm seeing, i take a deep breath and mutter to myself "ok.". 
apparently, i said "ok" a bit louder than i thought, cause the caretaker looks at me and says "ok?". i say "yes, ok.". to which then the caretaker again says "ok" and proceeds to yank off the skeleton's skulls and plops it into a small box on the ground. 
he then grabs the hand and begins cracking the fingers off piece by piece and also drops those in the small box.

from the background i hear my dad say "okay, we're gonna go now!"

Ground truth: went to watch an old relatives coffin get opened up so his remains could be put into a smaller box, to make room for my grandmas coffin. ended up watching a caretaker break down a skeleton piece by piece.

Input: Text: obligatory: this tifu happened 4 days ago not today.

my granddad called me around to do a few of diy jobs that he needed done. being the 'handyman' of the family, i tend to get these calls quite frequently. i got there and went through the first few jobs without a hitch. then he told me there was a problem with the light in the guest room. it had been working up until a couple of weeks ago, nothing had changed with the wiring but the light would no longer work even with a new bulb. half an hour of testing and troubleshooting ensues with a conclusion of a short on the wiring that runs through the loft.

i climb into the loft and try to find a route to where the wire goes through the ceiling to the light. the loft is definitely not designed well for negotiating your way around, very low clearance to the roof and insulation hiding the beams i need to stand on to avoid crashing through the ceiling. i find a possible path just past the water tank and start making my way.

**here is where the fu happens.** i try squeeze past the water tank but i brush the plastic bag holding the insulation around the tank. queue a sound like a waterfall and i panic. i back up to where i was and look at the tank, there is a crack in the tank which had obviously been spilling into the insulation bag for a while. my little nudge had been the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back and unleashed niagara falls in my grandparent's loft.

i climb out of the loft to find a bucket and notice water dripping down the wall. i walk over to it to see where it is coming from and,  as if sensing my presence, the water bursts through the wallpaper. i rush downstairs and there is water dripping out the ceiling in the kitchen. my grandparents are freaking out asking what is happening, i'm freaking out trying to figure out how i'm going to stop the water.

i find a large bucket and get it into the loft under the flow of water. i also manage to macgyver a partial fix by tying the tap that had caused the crack in the plastic tank into a position that slows the water flow substantially and the ball valve to stop the water inlet to the tank (old house and the inlet tap is impossible to turn). i had to bail out the remaining water in multiple trips just to ensure that there was no more leak damage.

now my grandparents have no heating or hot water while they wait for someone to come and put in a replacement tank. unfortunately my diy skills don't extend as far as plumbing in a new tank!

 

ps: sorry if the formatting is terrible, first ever post!
Response list: ["i tried to fix a leaky tank and it broke my grandparent's house down."]
Ground truth: went to fix an issue with a light, found out rats had chewed through the wire. went into the loft to fix the wire and released a deluge that had been trapped in the insulation surrounding a broken water tank. water broke through ceilings and walls and my grandparents are now without heating. oh, and the light still isn't fixed.

Input: Text: this actually happened today!

here's some background info: i work in a restaurant outside of the city limits, and i attend high school in town. it's a bit of a drive to get there... let the fu begin.

i was at work the day previous to the day previous of the fu (two days before the fu) and my boss asked me, "want to come in on wednesday?" (today) and i said, "sure." despite the fact that i had plans that day, and i knew it. i'm just afraid of disappointing my boss, and i had to find a way to cancel on him. i thought about it for two days. fast forward to the day of the fu. i'm just about to text him, "hey, super bogged down with homework today. won't be able to make it to work until friday" when i get a text from him, "just a reminder, the (name of restaurant) is in need of one [rhynofilms] tonight"
so i told him i'd be in at 5.
at 3, he texted me asking if i was still in town. for all intents and purposes, i was not. he needed me to pick up ground beef, but i said i would do that when i got to work. i get there, he gives me the business debit card, i take the highway into town. get the meat, and hop back on the highway. this highway, however, forks off into two highways. i was happily driving for 30 minutes before noticing that i didn't recognize any of the scenery around me. i was on the wrong highway for 30 minutes. as i continue driving, i read a sign that says, "now entering [city nowhere near mine]".
i'm now lost in an unfamiliar city, carrying raw meat and cucumbers, taking over an hour for a job that should take 30 minutes.  i placed a phone call to a navigator (my dad) and one to my boss (telling him that i took a wrong turn, and that i'd be there soon). i hopped back onto the highway, turned onto the correct one, and made it to work in record time. my boss, being the awesome guy that he is, asks me to explain myself in front of the new girl working there. i tell him, "well, good news. the weather in [that stupid city] is wonderful this time of year." he laughs, and pays for the gas that i burned, and for the hour that it took for me to get back. he says that the reason he paid me is because, "you were working. you were fucking up, but you were working." thus, leading me to post this here. i have the coolest boss in the world. that being said, because he was disappointed in me, i have to scrub the grease traps when i come in on friday.

edit: for clarification: yes, my boss was disappointed in me, but he didn't punish me monetarily. he has something else planned for me to make it up. i'll include the details when i'm not using a phone, but it is very unpleasant 

edit 2: added punishment for being an idiot
Response list: ["i was at work, boss asked me to come in on wednesday, i told him i'd be in town, i got a text from him, i took a wrong turn, got lost, called my dad, got back to work in 30 minutes, boss asked me to explain myself in front of the new girl working there. i told him i was working, and he paid me for the gas."]
Ground truth: i ran an errand for my boss, ended up in the wrong city. boss pays me anyway, but still embarrasses me in front of a new female co-worker. as punishment, i have to clean some real nasty grease traps

as i'm doing this i reach for phone on the side and notice a water bottle exactly like mine. this is when i look down and realize i'm snogging someone else's bottle. i put it back immediately and moved away, almost throwing up at the thought of it.

Input: Text: alright so a little back-story so i don't sound like too much of a loser. 

i currently live 130 miles away from the town i grew up and since i only do online courses in school the only way i meet people is through work.

well it was my 21st birthday. i've drank many times before though, but hey your first trip to a liquor store legally is a fun experience. i normally drink whisky, vodka, rum, amaretto/ just all sorts of beer.

i live with three guys. they all work third shift (i used to as well, which is how i met them) and now i work day shift which makes things a bit lonely in my apartment. 

but anyway flash back to around 8 am on my birthday. one of my roommates forgot it was my birthday so he went to his room and past out, another had no idea when my birthday was so he went to his room and started playing diablo 3. the last guy however woke me up and we started getting ready to go to the liquor store. 

well we get there and in my mind... i've drank a lot of stuff... i drink mostly beer and whisky now because it makes me a lot less sick than my favorite drinks. (mike's and vodka) i know. i'm a white girl stuck in a guys' body. so anyway i wanted to try something new, i really wanted to get some mixed drinks like.. the stuff to make margaritas or something! my roommate would not stop hounding me about it how "gay" it was to get what i wanted. (btw we live in ky. it's bad enough that i play tennis and wear slim fit clothing, so if i drink anything "girly" i get branded as a homosexual because.. you know, rednecks and stuff.)

so i end up just getting a 6-pack of dos equis and red bridge. so i get home and it's probably about 1pm at this point, my other two roommates wake up and i reminded them it was national free comic book day. so we went to get some comics. got back at about 3:30pm.

roommate 1: the one that came with me to the liquor store is asleep

roommate 2: also asleep. 

roommate 3: pitty played some mk10 with me for about 30 mins just because he didn't want me to be alone on my birthday. 


time is now 4pm. i honestly planned on just chilling alone having my first legal drinks, but a bunch of guys at work had the idea of having a huge party at my place at about 10pm. well not of them where replying on fb and things were looking vague so i started drinking. 

at about 5:30pm i dragged a camping chair out in the parking lot, propped my feet up on my impala, and kept on drinking and reading comics in the sun. randomly out of nowhere a guy i used to work with on my 3rd shift job rolled up. i didn't even know he knew where i lived.

this guy is a creep, literally the definition of creep. he's like 28 and lives alone with his mom, no girlfriend because he creeps the hell out of them all. but he's an alright guy. he gets out of his car and i stand and wobble over to him beer in hand and ask "how's it going?" fast forward a few minutes we go inside and just start chatting. the chat lasts about an hour and a half and he get's up and goes "well, i guess i'm headed home. i didn't even know it was your birthday i was just trying to find out if i knew anybody buying the maypac fight for tonight" and he leaves.

i keep drinking and i never drank the same beer twice. i grabbed a different one each time and lined them up on how much i liked them. 

at this point i realize no one from work is going to show up, my roommates have to leave for work at 9:50 pm, and my new girlfriend had a lot of school work/finals to study for. but i had a salvation...

there was a pretty cool guy i knew that i got a job at my current place of employment that was probably still coming. i met him through his wife, who i used to get absolutely shit faced with all of the time. they were both supposed to come over, so hey. it'd be an alright birthday celebration after all. 

well it's about 9:30pm and i'm still just drinking and drinking. i had my astro a40's on listening to hollywood undead's new album just kind of rolling around feeling good. i randomly looked over at our front door and notice the top of what looked like a girl's head. considering she looked to be about 4 foot nothing it had to be the  girl that was coming with her husband. i open the door and she darts in holding a bunch of pizza boxes. "sorry (husbands name) can't come over tonight he's passing a kidney stone."

so she sits on the couch and starts drinking with me. my roommates leave for work and it's just us. i'm extremely bored as i'm about to tell her i'm getting way to sleepy to stay up and she suggests getting the weed out of her car. she knew i'd never smoked it before but was curious. so you know, being intoxicated impairs your decision making. so i say "fuck it".

we go in the half/bath and she prepares a "bowl" whateverthefuckthatis.jpg she smokes a small about and hands it to me and i light the thing and smoke it until there's nothing but black ashes in it. nothing.

she's like "ooooh gosh i'm already so fucked up omg im so high lulz"

so i smoked literally 4 more bowls withen about 4 minutes. still nothing. i was probably way to drunk to feel it. well i go to take one last hit before giving up and i inhaled way too fucking hard and it scorched the inside of my throat. i started violently coughing and dropped her glass pipe and it busts fucking everywhere also catching the rug on fire. i start stomping the flames to death while trying to keep my balance just screaming "fuck me! fuck me! fuck me!". once the flames were put out i realized this girl was sitting on the toilet so high that she didn't even realize what just happened. so i pick her up, sit her on the couch, and proceed to trip and crawl into my bedroom and pass out.

i woke up with the worst sore throat i've ever had and i still had no idea what being high feels like.

Ground truth: i don't have any friends. i also dunno how to "marijuana"

Input: Text: obligatory disclaimer: this happened a couple of months ago. my friends encouraged me to post here about it and today i decided to. i know, i know...

so, a good friend of mine invited me to a cowboy themed drag show he was putting on as fund raiser for a pretty bad flood that happened in our area recently. i accepted and showed up on time but realized pretty quickly that "on time" is early and no one really shows up early anymore. should've known.

after the obligatory "hello's" and "how ya doin's" to my buddy and the other folks running the event, i found the bar and settled in. drink in hand, i began scoping out the few people that had trickled in since i arrived. i didn't really expect to find anyone i'd be into at this event but hey, i'd gone through a pretty bad break up a couple of weeks prior and was feeling desperate for some action. 

after chatting with the bartender for a while i finish my second drink. feeling a little loose, i turn around to check out the new arrivals when i notice an old friend of mine sitting alone at a table on her phone. 

i walk over, say hello and we begin to catch up. i hadn't seen angela (nope, not her real name) in about a year and find out she was in from out of town and meeting up with a few of the folks i planned on seeing this evening as well. score. we'd always had a mutual attraction to each other but never acted on it since i had always been in a relationship. obviously i'm thinking that shouldn't be a problem now.

the night progresses and we meet up with all our mutual friends. we drink. we dance. we have a blast. everything is going well and her and i are really hitting it off. 

once the show ends, someone suggests we go to another bar and as a group, we all agree. everyone is already quite drunk so inhibitions are pretty low. angela and i made out on our way to the bar and i'm feeling like a boss ass player. 

one or two bars later and we end up at an after hours dance club. it should be noted that angela and i pretty drunk at this point and i convinced myself that i'm some sort of amazing dance god. she's digging it even if i'm struggling to keep from falling down so i go in for the kill. 

"you wernt ta come over ter my place??"

i asked right before the beat dropped so i never actually heard what she said but it was something along the lines of, "sure. i guess."

fuck yes. i'm da best.

i call an uber and we start heading towards my apartment. she has us stop at a 7-11 to get her a toothbrush and i grab an ice cream sandwich. this night is going way better than i thought it would. 

we get home and our clothes start flying off. my buddy had given me a couple of viagra a while back so i pop one. i didn't want to get whiskey dick so it seemed like a good idea at the time. 

we start going at it and the viagra kicks in. my tony stark turns into iron man and for about 15 minutes, we have amazing sex. i feel like such a boss. 

she flips over and prepares herself to ride reverse cowgirl. i remember thinking, "hmmm. things seem a little dry down there." just before she slams down on the saddle. 

you know that moment when you're in so much unexpected pain that your brain doesn't even really register it? you know something bad just happened but you don't really feel it yet. that's about where i was in that moment. 

i shout in pain and push her off. i look down at my boy and blood is shooting out of the front. literally shooting out. the viagra and high alcohol content are pumping out blood like the fucking bellagio fountains. 

i run to the bathroom holding my junk and jump into the bath tub. she comes careening in after me shout-asking what the hell happened. i shout-tell her to shut up and take a deep breath before examining the damage. 

turns out, her forceful mount and lack of lube put an abnormal amount of stress on my bowstring (frenulum is the technical term) and popped the little guy right in half. 

so here i am, sitting naked in the shower, unwillingly rock hard, drunk and bleeding an impressive amount. she becomes hysterical, starts crying and calls her dad. 

why her dad? well, apparently he's a doctor. apparently she thinks he can give her some advice or home remedy to fix my broken bowstring at 4 am in the morning. yeah. i don't think so. 

you know what this guy says? "why are you talking to me? take him to the hospital." thanks angela's dad. real helpful.

after about 15 minutes, the bleeding slowed slightly but i'm starting to feel pretty woozy. the shock of the situation finally subsides and i begin laughing uncontrollably. i think, "this is what's happening to me right now. everything i've done in life has led up to me boner bleeding in the shower. this is what i have become." 

angela puts some clothes on and grabs the keys to my car. she tells me to get out of the shower and meet her out front to go to the er. i tell her she better yelp the best one because i'm not having some 4 star doctor handle my precious wounded hog. she's not very happy with me at that moment.

as i shamble out of the shower and gingerly put some clothes on, i look around for the nearest object to carry my broken junk in. maybe a smart person would grab a towel but nope, i grab a wide mouth mason jar that was sitting on the counter and tuck my dick and balls in that. why both? it was just more comfortable that way. 

the blood isn't coming out as much at this point but i still have an erection. pants pulled up to my thighs and holding the bloody mason jar between my legs, i walk outside and get in the car. 

we drive the 5 minutes to an urgent care (5 star rated on yelp, of course) and i walk in there with all my glory showing and no fucks to give. there's a few people in the waiting room but the guy behind the counter doesn't want me sitting in there with them because my pants aren't pulled up so i get the vip treatment and see the doctor right away. 

i explain the situation to dr. ted while nurse caroline takes my mason jar and throws it away (i mean, i didn't want it back i guess). ted is in his late 60's and and caroline isn't far behind in age. ted gets the thing clean and puts pressure on it when he drops the bad news. 

"op, the bleeding isn't really going to stop with out putting pressure on it. i don't want to stand here all night and hold your [glorious member] so we're gonna have to stitch it up." 

nope. 

i ask if there's anything else we can do. literally anything else. glue? bandaid? caroline puts pressure on it? no dice. 

in a last ditch effort, i ask for some sort of anesthetic but he explains that would be more painful than just getting the stitches. 

caroline holds my hand. i glare at angela. ted puts 3 stitches in. i cried. we all bonded. 

angela and i drove back to my place in silence. she left back to her hotel shortly after we got back. we haven't talked since then but i like to think the conversation with her dad the next day was very awkward. 

three days later i got the stitches out. ted and caroline weren't there so i had to explain the story to a whole new set of people. they laughed, a lot. i left them a 5 star review on yelp. 

 

edit: thanks for helping me get to the front page, all the kind words, and of course, the sweet sweet gold. i read all your comments and laughed a ton. my day has been made and i have a permanent smile on my face thanks to all of you.

Input: Text: so this actually happened today, unlike 95% of tifu posts. 

i was on my way to class to take a final (i take summer classes), my commute was going smoothly. i was about halfway there and still had 15 minutes to spare. now usually i'm a really aggressive driver but i thought to myself, "you know, i got time, i may as well just sit back and relax, enjoy my commute without driving like a dick."

here's where the fuck-up happens, i'm in a line of cars waiting for a light to turn green and there's a nun in a church van full of kids pulling out of the cvs directly to my right. me first thought was "zero chance i let this van in front of me". i second guessed myself, and thought "you know what this is a perfect opportunity to do my "good deed" for the day so i let her in. 

biggest mistake of my life. 

turns out she was driving to my school for only god knows what (no pun intended), so i follow her the entire way to my school. 19 mph in a 35. my less than 10 minute ride from that cvs, turned into 30. i showed up to my final 15 minutes late and my professor told me that i was not able to sit for the final because i was late. so in retrospect, i should've just said fuck the church van and continued driving like a dick.

Input: Text: i just moved to a new area and i was getting off the public transportation and somebody yelled at me, "do you go to [school redacted]?" i of course did not, but the kid then said i looked like somebody from there and began to talk with me.

he complemented my recent haircut and introduced himself. he then got to talking with me about my background and his own. i kept talking to this kid for some reason. he seemed fine – he was well dressed, had a good job and was heading to a meeting of his own school's alumni.

as he was leaving to go to his meeting, he asked for my number to text me about some business opportunity nearby. he vaguely called it, "big businesses." i wasn't thinking much or at all for that matter and gave him my number.

at this point, he had my number, my first and last name, the college i actually went to and my place of work. i looked the kid up and everything he said was true, he did go to that college, he was a member of his alumni club, he did have the good job he said he had, but it was still odd. he was vague about what his "opportunity" was.
i originally thought this kid would never contact me again, but then he called me tonight. i deflected, hung up and then blocked him from my phone or finding my facebook and linkedin. i don't know whether this question could lead to his finding who i am, so i'm posting this from a throwaway.

i think he was trying to recruit me for a mlm, but i was wondering whether he could do anything else against me with the information he has. i know i sound a bit crazy, but i will be honest – i am a bit afraid. i have (hopefully) learned my own lesson to not talk to people like that, but just wanted thoughts from other people on my idiocy.

Input: Text: so this was a few years ago, but in a previous job we had these emergency transponder silent alarms where you press the button and it alerts the police there was trouble and that you were in danger and could not reach the phone. so as a joke, i made this one day to put on my boss's door:

my boss's office is in the 'inner perimeter' of the business, and customers are not supposed to get out of the front lobby. well somehow they did, and when we were out to lunch a prospective client somehow got past the lobby, into the back offices, and tried to 'ring' by boss but instead told the police there was a dangerous intruder. well we got back to see the client and his assistant in cuffs, in the lobby, being questioned by police. unfortunately they didn't have the same sense of humor as i did and they become not clients awfully quickly. fortunately, my boss was a funny guy and laughed it off and told me to find other clients to make up for it.
Response list: ["i made a joke about my boss's door, and he laughed it off."]
Ground truth: i accidentally tricked people into pressing a silent alarm button and they weren't entertained by the handcuffs.

Input: Text: so, i'm a film major in college and as part of a final project, a friend and i rented out the school's studio to build a set for a shoot over this coming weekend. this required up to start painting flats and setting things up while not disrupting the set that was currently built inside the studio (he had it until thursday).

behind the set the other student had built, there were two spare triple flats (basically 2-12x8 ft. walls made of plywood/2x4's) leaned against each other, one had leg braces supporting it, but the other did not. we needed to take the one that had legs out back to paint it, which posed the question: what do we do with this other triple flat that can't stand on its own?

my friend set out to find the equipment room manager to lend his expertise, while i pondered how in the holy hell we were going to get this thing out of the tiny corner it found itself in, let alone get it out the door. he returned with not the equipment room manager, but instead another student. he said his office was locked and that he got the next best thing: a random dude he found in the hallway!

the three of us look at the task at hand for a moment, before the new guy says he has it figured out and starts un-clamping the legs. and as a human being with absolutely no foresight or questions for a man who seems to know what he’s doing, i followed his lead and detached the rest of the legs. once they were removed, our hero lord and savior tells me to grab the other end of flat #2 and the two of us will lift it and take it out of here while my friend supports the original one that never had any legs.

i should also mention that on the far right side of the flat, there is a giant glass window that weighs about 4 metric fucktons. guess which side of the wall i ended up grabbing.

once the two of us get it out and around the corner, this modern day saint tells me to put it down and he looks around for a moment before saying "i have no idea where we can put this," followed by promptly walking out and to look for the equipment room manager himself.

so, i'm holding up one huge, heavy, wall on one side of the room, and my friend is holding up an equally as huge and heavy wall on the other side of the room under the impression that help was on the way. because we couldn't actually see each other, i shouted across the room to let my friend know to just keep holding, it'll only be another minute or so.

20 minutes later, there is still no sign of the manager, or the good samaritan that got us into this pickle. at this point, we're both pissed, but we couldn’t physically place these flats down because there was no room and they’re too heavy for one guy to lift on their own. because the door was closed, there's no point in trying to yell out to someone to help through a soundproof studio. it's basically the first saw movie, minus the not-so dead guy in between us.

suddenly, i realize that i have not kept up on my daily hydration and start scanning he room for the water bottle i never should have put down to grab the flat in the first place. i spot it on the other end of the room, just outside of my friend's grasp.

i mention this to him, and because he's such a swell individual, he starts macgyvering a way to grab it and with the hopes of somehow hail mary-ing it to me. he is able to get his legs around one of the leg braces that used to do the job we inherited and uses it like a hockey stick for double amputees. he slap-shots it to me and i shit you not, it hits my foot dead on and stops faced up.

after a few moments of celebrating, i look down at the bottle and now realize the flaw in our plan. this whole time i had been keeping this thing balanced with both hands. "aw, fuck it" i said, "i can hold it with one arm for a second."

i could not.

as i leaned down for the bottle, i remember thinking, "ah, this is easy" then i looked back up at this massive chunk of wall starting to lean backwards. i immediately jump back up and put my hands out to force it back up, but physics weren't on my side. i ended up using both hands and my neck (dumb fucking idea) to try keeping it afloat, but gravity is a fickle cunt.

right in the flat's trajectory, there is a metal cart about 4 feet tall. remember that heavy glass window i mentioned? yeah, that slammed right into the corner of the cart.

because i was holding it, the glass wasn't entirely shattered, but it made a spider web crack through the bottom pane of glass.

my friend shouts out "what the hell was that?" and i, while still pinned under the flat like it's 127 hours, for some reason just shout back "i'm fixing it!" in that moment, i gathered the strength of a thousand men and slid the whole thing across the room, knocking over a few set pieces from the other guy's set and plopped the thing down flat on the ground with a loud thud.

"seriously, what the fuck happened?!" my friend shouts from his still standing flat. i emerge from the rubble with the water bottle in my hand. "i was thirsty. now i'm gonna go find <equip. manager>." and i storm out.

by this point, he was back in his office and the douchebag who left us in there to die never even told him anything was up. i explained the whole situation and he came to help with two other guys and together we got those two flats out of there. thankfully, we can make do without the window i smashed, so the entire shoot won’t suffer, but god damn, i just want to know where that random guy went. i also now realize that we easily could have just called someone to come help us out, but hey, hindsight’s 20-20.
Response list: ['i was holding up a huge wall, my friend was holding up another huge wall, and we were both pissed.']
Ground truth: holding up a tv flat. got thirsty. got water. dropped flat. broke a window.

Input: Text: tifu by talking too much.

before i get into my fu, i'm posting from my phone and apologize in advance for any formatting fails.

i'm an escort. aka prostitute, hooker, ho, whore, courtesan, etc. this happened yesterday.

i got a call 3 days ago from a gentleman we will call tommy. what made tommy vastly different from my other clients was that tommy is gay. he explained to me that he needed a female to accompany him to dinner at his parents house, and be very flirty/mildly affectionate towards him. from what i gathered, he seemed desperate to keep his sexual orientation a secret from his family. 

no problem! i would receive my regular rate plus a little extra to cover my gas and time to get to his apartment so we could arrive together, plus the promise of a nice tip for a very convincing show.

the town tommy lives is is about 2 towns over in the next county, and has an "adult superstore" that i have never visited. i decided to leave 2 hours early to give myself plenty of time to browse. i'm always on the lookout for new toys, lingerie, lubes, and the such to spice things up for clients.

i found a very intriguing product there among the usual fare called the "feeldoe". it's a totally different approach to a strap-on and it was something i thought would make my job much easier. i get many bookings for fetish sessions that include strap-on play, and those bastards are hard as hell to control. this product looked like exactly what i needed.

i proceeded to the checkout lane with my items, and upon getting there realized the girl in line ahead of me had the exact same feeldoe! i asked her if she had ever used one before and she said no, that her husband had read about it online and had sent her to find one. i commented on the price, and said that i could justify it in my head as work expenses. she asked what i did, and i told her i was an escort. she told me she had always been fascinated by that type of work, and asked me if i met a lot of sickos. i said no, most of the guys i meet are just very nice, lonely guys who have needs. a lot of them don't even want sex. i used tommy as an example. i explained he was gay, and would apparantly do anything to hide that fact from his family and had hired me to assist in the charade. i then joked that for what he was paying me, i should offer to use the feeldoe on him after dinner.

i pay, leave with my purchases and head to tommy's place. we head over to his parents place a bit early because he wanted his father to look at something to do with his car. 

we walk in the front door and his mom takes my coat, tommy introduces us, and says he needs to go explain this car thing to his dad and he will be right back. his mom says she and tommy's sister are just finishing up supper and asks if i would like to have a drink with them in the kitchen before dinner. of course! 

i follow her into the kitchen and she says, "hooker bloopers, this is tommy's sister kadence". omfg it's the woman i was speaking to in line at the adult store! i feel my face flush and i may have actually said fuck under my breath. she gave no indication we had ever met and exchanged nice to meet you etc. chit chat. 

the dinner went remarkably well and she didn't out either of us. i told his parents i was a massage therapist. they seemed to like me and invited me back. but the entire dinner, everytime i looked at her, i couldn't help but remember the remark about using the feeldoe on her brother.
Response list: ['i was an escort, i got a call from a guy i thought was a nice guy, i told him i was an escort, and he told me i was a massage therapist.']
Ground truth: i accidentally outed a client of mine to his sister while buying a strap on dildo and joking about using it on him.

Input: Text: i was at the mall with my friends because we wanted to see a movie but all of the movies were sold out. one of my friends suggested we try the free samples in the food court. first one we stop at is this chinese food place. all three of us take a sample and as we're getting ready to leave the woman giving them out stops me, pulls me over to the counter and forces me to buy food because we're not allowed to take the samples without buying anything. i cant understand a thing she is saying either because she is yelling, people are talking all around me, and she is very bad at speaking english. when the guy is giving me the food he didn't ask what i wanted just threw rice and chicken on my plate and charged me 15$. the guy at the register asked if i wanted a drink. after he explained to me that the 15$ i paid didn't cover the cost of a soda i politely declined his offer for a drink. at least he was honest. one of my friends left while i was dealing with this and as i sat down to eat the food i didn't really want i saw that he had the same food as me that he bought from the other chinese food place right next to the one i was at.... for 5$. the only reason i bought anything from there was because i didn't want them to call the cops and tell them i stole from them. food wasn't that bad though, just insanely overpriced!
Response list: ["i wanted to see a movie, took a free sample of chinese food, got pulled over by a guy who was giving me food and charging me 15$ for it. i didn't want to pay for a drink, so i declined. i saw that the guy had the same food as me, and i didn't want to steal from him."]

Input: Text: some background information: i've been single for 3 years now, and, well, haven't had sex since.

i work at a grocery store, and this past week i was being taught how to order. my supervisor (fairly attractive, mid 30s i'd say) was helping to expedite the process by working ahead of me, straightening products in the freezer doors. she got pulled away for a moment, and i caught up to where she had been working. when she came back, she picked up where she had left off by squeezing in front of me, bent over to finish the lower shelves. not a problem in itself, i'm tall, and was working on the upper shelves. however... when she squeezed past me, she brushed against my thigh. for whatever reason, i got immediately turned on and had a half chub. as i try to scan a product she decides to back up and backs right into my crotch and gets full contact with my semi-erection. needless to say, she hurried ahead, and made sure to move faster than i was.

Input: Text: so this is a collision of two days of me not being so smart.  day 1, was yesterday, i was excited to go to washington d.c. to be in the annual rolling thunder motorcycle parade.  this was my first time ever and was on my bucket list ever since i purchased my motorcycle.  we leave at 0800 in the morning and arrive at the parking lot at 1000, not bad as the parade starts around 1200.  i go around and look at bikes, estimated 600,000, but to my dismay they are mostly black harleys.  i found out we are in the last overflow lot so we are able to watch the start and then walk back to our lot to get ready.  one the ten minute walk was over i sat in/near my bike until we were ready to go...... three hours later (spongebob voice over)...... i am more red than a freshly cooked later.... mistake one....

note today i volunteered to help with an elementary 1k/5k fun run.  i helped direct the runners on certain areas of the track, they even have me a bright flag to look official!  as i am waiting on the race to start the nats begin attacking.  i know, i will use the flag and wave it around my head to keep them away.  about my third wave i flick the flag back and just like a wet towel it makes a loud **crack** , only it makes contact with my burnt, crispity, crackly forehead.  i feel like an idiot and i can't run my head due to the tight, burnt skin that feels as though it is on fire if you when look at it wrong......

Input: Text: that it was cherry cheesecake (my fucking favorite guilty pleasure) should have been a warning. hell, the post-it declaring it mine should have been the warning. it was left-handed handwriting and there’s only one lefty that lives here. 

god, i’m such an idiot. i know, i should have known it was too good to be true, but it was 3am and i was hungry—why would i pass up what was obviously the work of some good-spirited obesity elves? would *you*? anyway, i was so hungry that i, in my stupidity, did not recognize the cheesecake for what it was: a weapon. 

…maybe i should give you guys some background information here. **skip to the tl;dr, if you must, this will be a long, (and possibly a bit dark, i guess) read.**  

see, on any given day, my home has the potential to become a war zone and i like to say that all outcomes considered, i, a 22yof, have learned to cope with it pretty well. over the years, i learned to develop a way of living that would keep me sane without the use of drugs (besides sleeping pills), and maybe only a little bit of alcohol. this way of living isn’t cheap or easy, and to be honest, i’m surprised it’s gone on as long as it has without being interrupted. before today, that is. anyway, the rules are thus:

- if nothing else, do not accept his gifts
- buy your own groceries, mini-fridge, microwave, and/or hot plate so that you can cook your meals in your room and avoid stolen food mishaps
- have a source of entertainment in your room, be it books, a computer, a handheld gaming system or a tv with netflix to minimize contact with him in the outer rooms
- everything you own, buy yourself so that he can’t take it away/destroy it as ‘punishment’ or out of retaliation, and if he does, you can file a police report under destruction of property/robbery
- under no circumstances accept his gifts
- have a lock on your door, convince him that it was ‘his idea’ so that he won’t feel inclined to assert his authority and break it
- have some kind of income to pay for all this shit and make sure you’re also in school so that when you get home you can’t do anything but shower and hit your pillow
- under *no fucking circumstances* do you *accept his gifts* 
 
somehow, dear reddit, i managed to break my most important rule of all by eating that cheesecake. to put it simply, i fucked up. first of all, it wasn’t in my mini-fridge; i had no business looking in there in the first place. i was just so damn *hungry* and it was the middle of the night so i figured no one would notice and start an argument if something was missing. besides, it fucking had my name on it! it was practically begging me to eat it, for chrissake!

as you may already have guessed, it was a setup. my stepfather had gone and intentionally put that traitorous, creamy, son-of-a-bitch motherfucker in there. he’d put it in there knowing that i would be hungry and exercising of poor judgement after a long day and he knew that i would take one look at the cheesecake and my sleep-addled brain would mistake it for a godsend. he knew that i couldn't buy groceries this week, and he fucking did it on purpose.

see, my stepfather is a sociopath. and, like most high-functioning sociopaths, at first glance, anyone with eyes would say that he’s a hardworking, family-oriented type of guy—you know, your usual run-of-the-mill, morally upstanding breadwinner. sucks that his family doesn’t appreciate him, he tries so hard to be a good father. even refers to his stepdaughter as his own blood. wow, what a great guy. 

except, he’s not like that—not at all. he’s so good at acting like he is, though, that even if you gouged a hole in his carefully constructed facade with a jackhammer, you still wouldn’t get a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg (how’s that for metaphor?). he’s so good at it that, at times, i think he believes it himself. i say this because he’s gone to the er multiple times for “chest pain”, and each time it’s after he’s done something horrific enough to cause a few outsiders to look a little closer.

my sister believes it’s (the chest pain) from guilt. i’m on the fence on whether he is capable of feeling guilt. i think it’s more along the lines of, “i need the attention shifted away from the fact that i just pulled a move from wwe on my daughter—who is totally lying about that by the way, *she* attacked *me*, i was acting in *self defense*—to how pitiful and in pain i am. i might die from the strain on my heart, says the doctor, and no one would care. woe. woe is me.”

…i’m getting sidetracked again. the point is that i fucked up and ate the cheesecake. the cheesecake was so delicious that when i found out he’d put it there for me, i couldn’t imagine that he did it for an ulterior motive. i think my actual line of thought was, *how could something so good be used for evil?* and the sad thing was that already i was viewing him in a totally different light—i was feeling sorry for him and the fact that my mom was finally growing a pair and kicking him out. 

i found myself thinking that maybe she was just overreacting. i found myself thinking things like, "so what if he destroyed her phone because there was a text he didn't want her to read on it? people accidentally send texts to group chats all the time!" and,  "so what if he'd intended for it to go to another (married) woman? that lady is totally cool, we've known her for years--she'd never be inappropriate, even if it was at 4:30 in the morning!"

never did it cross my mind that i had unwittingly become ammunition in his fight to stay, even as i began to doubt that removing him from our home might be a solution to most, if not all of our problems. 

it is only now, as i sit here typing this and the cheesecake is undoubtedly congealing in my gut, do i realize how far under his thumb he has gotten all of us. it has been two weeks since my mother has told him to leave, and he is still fucking here. he even put all his things back into her closet. i can sense that my mother is slowly beginning to have doubts as well—i caught her eating a rocky road ice cream he left for her in the freezer this afternoon. needless to say i feel like i just swallowed a sack of bricks. 

i’m guessing he’s going to be here for a while longer.
Response list: ['i ate a cheesecake.']
Ground truth: i ate a slice of cheesecake and it (almost) fooled me into thinking step-dad was a good guy. he’s not. and he won’t leave.

Input: Text: ok, this tifu actually happened when i was in 7th grade, (im 20 now) but alas, i did not know what reddit was when i was in middle school. 


it was my seventh grade history class, and my great teacher happened to be sick that day, and was replaced with a morbidly mean substitute, who we will call ms c. ms c seemed like a happy person, but at second glance you would notice that she scoffs at any misbehavior, and has a low tolerance for annoying kids. 


me, being an annoying kid myself, tried my best to cause all kinds of mischief. i was the kind of kid who loved attention, and would go at great lengths to get myself in trouble just to make somebody laugh. but, knowing ms c, i knew i would have to fly a bit under the radar so i didn’t get myself screwed over and sent to the principal's office. thus, i would laugh and giggle with my friends quietly while class was starting, and she gave me an evil looking eye.


she stood up and spoke in her monotone voice, announcing that we will have to be participating in a longer worksheet than we normally do. me, being the obnoxious kid i was, decided to blurt out “i’d rather just kill myself instead….”, which made my other careless friends around me laugh.


but, ms. c did not laugh, she glared at me, and with a moment's pause, she screams “go to the nurse now!” me, being a seventh grader, was confused as all hell with my other classmates. i stood up and as she pushed me out the door, i thought to myself, why the nurse? is that worse than the principal? what the fuck would the nurse be able to do to me? so i decide to wander around the hallways, contemplating my fate. it is only after 5 minutes that the sub notices me and pushes me all the way to the nurse.


ms c makes me tell the nurse what i said, and i do. “it was just a joke,” i said, “it didn’t mean anything”, i explain afterwards. she, for some reason, nods her head in understanding, and tells me my guidance counselor will be there shortly. as a seventh grader, at this point i am freaking the fuck out, and i don’t really understand what i am supposed to do. 


i end up talking to the guidance counselor, who called my parents and told them i wanted to commit suicide. my parents also drove straight to the school while my mom teared up in fear. i had to explain everything to them, and they almost did not believe me because the school told them otherwise. on top of that, i was told i had to have weekly meetings with the guidance counselor while they tried to figure out what was wrong with me. eventually they realized i was just kidding, (fucking duh) and i got to stop having sessions with the guidance counselor. on top of all this, all the kids in my history class thought this was hilarious, and i was made fun of by my entire seventh grade class for the rest of the school year. just about almost everyday i was known as the kid who told our sub i wanted to kill myself. my friends still like to bring it up to me this day.
Response list: ['i told my sub i wanted to kill myself, and i was made fun of by my entire seventh grade class.']
Ground truth: i jokingly told a substitute teacher i wanted to kill myself instead of doing a homework assignment, and i was forced to talk to my nurse and have guidance counselor meetings until i was “fixed”. also, my whole grade got to make fun of me for the year.

Input: Text: this wasn't a terribly recent fuck up, however after someone doing a good deed for me encoraged me to pass the good fortune on by helping others

i was just about to move into a new house, a house that didn't have a fridge or freezer in it. being an older building standard sizes which were readily available weren't going to be suitable, so one had to be ordered and was going to take 6-8 weeks to be delivered. living without s fridge for up to 2 months was going to suck!

after hearing of my predicament a friend offered me her beer fridge from her garage. wonderful. problem solved, especially as it wasn't terribly large i could fit it in my relatively small car, and it would fit in the house. problem solved and my new chilly appliance worked flawlessly during the waiting period

once the new fridge freezer had arrived, the beer fridge was moved to the spare room before being returned to it's rightful owner, only she decided she didn't want it back as they hadn't missed it, and it just took up room. 

motivated by her kindness, i cleaned that fridge better than i'd ever cleaned any fridge before in my life, even plugged it back in and left a bunch of quartered lemons to make sure it smelled as fresh a mountain forest

once clean, i placed an advert on a freecycle website as available immediately and waited for replies to come in. within an hour i received an enquiry from a man who had lost his job end was really struggling to make ends meet, his fridge had quit on him and he didn't have the funds to replace it. the perfect candidate i thought, karma was going to be passed on and i was feeling pretty good. we arranged that the man would collect the fridge the next day and i went to bed with a warm glow

he arrived, checked out the fridge and was overjoyed with how clean it was, and what a relief that they could keep good cold again. the two of us struggled down the stairs with the fridge, at which point i saw his car for the first time, which was tiny, even smaller than my car. to make things worse, the trunk of his car didn't open and he thought it would just go in through the back door, which it clearly wouldn't. anyone with even a miniscule amount of spatial awareness would be able to tell this wasn't going in the back door unless it was crushed. he explained that he couldn't afford to get the lock fixed and they'd just learned to live with it.

not wanting to carry that freaking thing back up the stairs, i took it upon myself to go grab a screwdriver and climb into the trunk of his car and manually pop the lock open! problem solved, it would now fit in the car with the back seats down, although it would be kinda tight in his little hatchback. i showed him how to manually open the lock with said screwdriver while the trunk was open and he was overjoyed with this newly learned piece of information, not only had i just given him a fridge, i'd also showed him how to open his trunk!

i stood and watched him drive away, waving goodbye with a warm glow in my heart, which slowly faded as i realized that there was no way he could manually open the trunk because the entirety of the back seats and trunk was now taken up with the fridge.

i have visions of an power extension cord running from his house into the back of the car and him trotting out in his dressing gown to grab milk first thing in the morning
Response list: ["i gave a man a fridge, he didn't have the funds to replace it, and he didn't know how to open his car trunk. i showed him how to open his trunk with a screwdriver, and he drove away with a warm glow in my heart."]
Ground truth: gave away a fridge to someone in need, ended up locking it in the broken trunk of their car

so i am applying to a research this program this year, and the application was basically the equivalent of a college application and i was royally screwed because it was due monday i had done barely 1% of it. but by gods grace and the fact i live in nj, we had a snow day. taking advantage of the gift i spend the whole day working on this application. (note: i have a a really bad habit of never saving things, often times i'll just leave the window open and not save it). fastforward many hours to 8 p.m. i finally finished most of my application and there are only couple essays left which i left to do over the weekend. so like a complete dumbass i haven't saved but i was just sitting and gave a sigh of relief. here i was thinking i was finally done and could relax and enjoy the rest of my snowday. now my application was currently split into two, the small 1% i had done earlier and the majority of the app. so, in order to combine the two, i open a new doc and copy the majority of the app, after copying that part i close the window and click do not save changes. then all of a sudden my mom yells. distracted by her yelling i go ahead and copy the other 1%. after she fi sines i head to the new doc and paste. only the the small 1% pops up. confused i keep repeatedly pressing ctrl+v only the 1% pops up. where the fucking hell is the resr of my application?!?!. then it dawns on me. i just sit there wide eyed and slowly twitching. i frantically rush trying yo re-open words and... nothing, the one time i actually needed an auto-save file there's nothing there. i try googling everything searching for a answer. after an hour i had pretty much lost all hope, when there's a sudden glimpse of hope. i read that mac has a temp folder for documents like these. rushing, i open the folder, sure enough there are a some rtfs in there (rich text files) i start opening some up and sure enough there are some old documents i never saved. i proceed through the list and arrive at the the file that was edited today. holding my breath i open it, thinking it's my saving grace and.... gibberish. it's all character gibberish without a single english letter . all the other files were perfectly fine, but the one file i needed the most recent file was corrupt. i sit paralyzed and proceed to scream every curse known to mankind. i had to finish most of the app today otherwise i wouldn't be able to finish the essays over the weekend. so i open a fresh doc at 8 pm and start working once again. fast forward to 3 am and it's done. i sit there in the middle of the night holding this app like gollum in lotd going "my precious" so long story short in a supreme fu i wasted a perfectly good snow day.
Response list: ['i wasted a snow day on an application.']
Ground truth: wasted a perfectly good snow day by not saving an app that took 7 hours to make

Input: Text: so heres some background. i'm a 13 year old asian child who likes to pc game. gaming is my life so to say. 

 however my parents aren't so keen on it. they think its the work of the devil and only "madmen" play it (even when evidence is shown that it's the consumed piece of media). also they're your typical asian overbearing parents that you see only much worse. they get angry on a scale where i feel scared for my life. aleast before. now i've gotten used to it.

but recently its gotten worse.

also when i mean parents i mostly refer to my dad. my mum is a nice person most of the time.

 they're really high demanding on grades. now, i'm in the highest set for almost everything but they still seem dissapointed and overly demanding. i also get extremely high grades and they still seem dissapointed. sometimes they just ignore my existence. before anyone tells me its because they love me, i'm pretty sure its not. again this is mostly from my dad. i even said what would happen if i don't live with you and his reply was "no. i would disown you. you also have to give me all your salary". he always ridicules me. he always complains about me. he always compares me to his freind's sons who are a lot more older and expreinced and therefore a lot more academically acheived then me. i'm not even sure that sentence is plausable. sometimes it's just ridiculous. for example a few years ago, their was a 5 year old in bangladesh who was quite smart. he could spell words where at the time i could barely say. bare in mind that i'm really shit at spelling but never the less my dad ended up comparing me to him. he started browsing videos of how much more smarter this child was then me. he then happened to come across the child playing super mario 64 i think it was. he instantly clicked away saying why would such a smart child play video games. he then praised this child as if it was the second coming of christ and proceeded to rant at me on why i was a stupid child. i then remarked that he didn't know how to spell or know the meaning of anythese words let alone pronounce them. he then told me to shut up and continued on his preeching of the second coming of christ and how i was basically the anti christ. bare in mind he acutally didn't talk about christ as i live in "muslim" household.

 my mom is a reasonable person. she listens to to logic. unless in involves religion or my farther.

 so i'm a huge game fanatic. i also consider myself a critic albeit a shit one. that makes me resistant to the shit ubisoft likes to feed me. i mostly pc game but i own consoles aswell. i'm not allowed to go outside not even to go to my freinds house. the only time i go out in my free time is when i went comicon months ago with my freinds but that took hours of begging and me being ignored. so naturally gaming is my only form of escapism. i also read books like game of thrones and such. i play with freinds. but this all stopped when i came home after having gcse 6th period basically meaning i'm coming home late. but i have to go to a mosque and learn the quran their. now i haven't gone in weeks due to school and i wasn't planning on going today either. my parents however had other plans. they told me to go. i asked them nicely can i not go. they started cursing at me and saying i was possesed. i consider my agnostic but am irl a muslim. if i told them i was agnostic the shit they'd pull would be extremely hostile. so i don't. my dad said okay he have doesn't have to go. he then proceeded to take everything in my room starting my pc. he even took my shitty chair. all he left me with was my bunk bed that i share with brother. he told me that the pc was the reason i abandoned god. he then had the audacity to set my pc up in his room. bare in mind that he often goes on my pc for my video editing software that i help him with. 

 skip a few days and i haven't talked with him. he had my phone but my mom gave it back. i try to stay away from home but they call the school and asked them to monitor me. it's saturday now. my dads files got deleted because he's a fucking moron when it comes to computer. so he got really angry at me. he came into my room and decided to blame his incompetence on me. i told him i didn't do anything and he decides to smash everything in my room,sweep my shelves and kick my shit around till everything was broken. my revisions guides,essays years of work and my drawing all destroyed. now my bedroom smells of orange juice and my leg is bleeding from broken glass. 

i system restored the computer but hes acting as if i dont exist. nothing is appealing him.

 all i want to do is go back to gaming. gaming media has tuaght me all i know. not to take shit from companies l learnt from total biscuit and jim fucking sterling son. i learnt not everyone is a douchebag on youtube from inthelittlewood. i learnt that not all companies are ubisoft from devolver digital's games. i learnt fancy words from yahtzee which helped me in debate club. 
i don't want to report my family or anything. i don't want to lose my mom (even when she's unreasonable when my dads around sometimes). i don't want to leave my brother. i just want go back to gaming.

reddit i need your help.

Input: Text: i am currently on a music tour in italy, sharing a room with four other men. obviously not having had sex since the day before we left for the one week trip, tensions were running high, and my extremely horny girlfriend back home was sending me intimate messages, which was not helping in any way. by day four of the trip, i was climbing up the walls with sexual frustration, not having had a wank in all of this time (this is not a long time i know, but needs must). it was early on the morning on the fifth day, and i was the first person in the room up. i went to have a shower in our room bathroom and i took phone with me, and checked my messages. i had received some photos from my girl back home, which didn't leave much to the imagination, and i couldn't take it any longer: so i had a speedy wank in the shower. but after i had finished, i couldn't see where the 'produce' had gone due to the colour of the tiles, so i assumed it had been washed down the plug hole so i left it, with my conscience clear. a short 15 minutes later, one of my room mates opened the shower door after having just showered with a pained expression on his face. it turns out he was very tired and had decided to sit down in the shower, and had ended up sat in my sticky pile of sperm. he didn't realise, went to dry off, and wiped it onto his towel, which he then used to wipe his face, and smeared into his eye. my first reaction was to blame the poor innocent guy who sleeps in the bed next to me, who was still asleep, and said he had done it the night before. none of the room is talking to him, and he is still denying it to everyone.

Ground truth: somebody sat on the floor in the shower and ended up wiping my spunk in their eye, blamed roommate, no regrets.

Input: Text: tifu a few years ago. was working on a movie (small low- budget indie), the director was a friend who basically knows everything there is to know about filmmaking, from screenwriting to lighting to shooting. because it was such a super low budget thing we only had one rental truck that stored camera gear, grip/electric gear, and a few things got other departments here and there. we obviously didn't have teamsters, so my friend asked me to drive the truck to set, and he would prep for the day instead of having to drive.

so anywho truck is running low on fuel one morning (i had said we should fill up the night before but he didn't want to stop). i hop out, put the company card into to dispenser of gasoline which has both unleaded and diesel, grab the unleaded, and start pumping.

i pump blissfully for oh about 20 gallons when oh shit. like a ton of bricks.

i know that if one even starts a diesel truck that has unleaded fuel in can potentially ruin the engine, if you drive it will definitely ruin it. i don't think there's any way to fix it.
i debate whether i should just walk away and never look back, get an office job where you don't suddenly get asked to drive a truck and wake up at 4:00a and you can sleep and sit in a chair. 
but then i manned up and opened the truck door, and said: '(director?) i just put unleaded in the truck'. he didn't believe me at first. i ran to my pickup truck a mile down the road, drove back to the truck, we loaded up the camera gear and a flag kit and bounce card (which by a miracle from god was all we needed for that day, bc we were doing steadicam shots outside, using natural light), and drove like hell to get to set. truck was towed and siphoned, we got all we needed for the day.

amazingly, the director said nothing about my fuck up to anyone. when people obviously asked where the truck was/what happened, he told them he put unleaded in the truck. good guy. i was extremely impressed. he also didn't yell or freak out during the craziness. not a single harsh word. good dude.

Input: Text: this happened about 4 hours ago. 

so imagine me, a young 20 year old with a  bright and cheery disposition, working in an ice cream shop in a very (very) small town. at this particular time, a fairly decent little rush of touring people came in. it quickly got very loud in the building, but as my only coworker was on break, i took it upon myself to both tend the cash register and scoop the ice cream. nothing new!

but alas, there was something new! we just got a new flavor, coconut pinapple. now here's the thing: the person working the cash register writes the tags, and then hangs them to be filled. when we do so, we abreviate the flavors. coconut pinapple became "cp." as i wrote it for the first time, i thought, "wow, that's the same letters as child porn. better not say child porn."

well, i eventually filled the first order, and i yelled, above the crowd, "who had the single cup of child porn?"
my boss freaked out, i went on break immediately. after i explained, she laughed her ass off and the day went on.

 

edit: thank you very much, /u/schartman and friends, for narrating this! you can view the hilarious video [here](https://youtu.be/c1uzfohxbc4)!

Input: Text: okay i’ll start off by saying that this didn’t happen today, but exactly a week ago (pancake tuesday for the christian homies). tl;dr at the bottom. 


i, like many others, am currently suffering with a case of bcs syndrome (broke college student syndrome). the symptoms can be quite horrendous, and can often land you in some pretty sticky situations. for example, the opportunity of receiving things for free is one not to be ignored. yes, the mere mention of the word “free” in a college email or pamphlet is bound to result in a crowd of dozens of students, clambering to get their free pen or condom or whatever the student union decided to give away this week.
 
there are however, risks when availing of such things. 

it was 9am, i stumbled into class to see my excited friend throw me her phone, offering me an email to read (an email that i, and everyone had also received, but who in god’s name has the energy to check their email before midday?). i didn’t read the email properly of course, as the only thing i noticed were the words “free pancakes”. of course we promptly told our other friends and they too were thrilled at the idea of free food, so we copied the address into google maps, and made our way to the mysterious building of free pancakes. 

i should inform you at this stage that i am an atheist, i was raised by atheists who allowed me to choose my own religion, was sent to catholic school (it was hard to find a non-religious school in ireland in the 90’s) and, around age 15, i decided that i didn’t believe in any of the religions that were presented to me. i should also say that i have absolutely nothing against religion, i have respect for people regardless of what they believe in, and it’s just not for me. also, most of the people in my class are atheists, including everyone that accompanied me on the “free pancakes” adventure.

so we got to this house, my friend with the google maps stopped, “this is it!”, she said, an uneasy smile on her face. we all knew something wasn’t right about this. we had ended up in a housing estate, a cul de sac, a suburban array of houses. and here we were, six 20-something year old girls, standing outside this pretty normal looking house. (usually, when the college has any sort of  event or cook-out, it occurs on campus, in the student centre or one of the surrounding buidings, not in some house..)

well of course we had to at least ring the doorbell, there was free food at stake. 

we were greeted by this rather friendly (but very rather old) priest. yes, a priest. needless to say we were seriously confused at this point. “ah come in, come in! put yer bags in the spare room there. come into the kitchen!”.  we subtly looked at one another and then threw daggers at the girl who originally suggested this trip. “ah go on in there to the sitting room and i’ll make ye a cuppa tea!”, said the priest, who we had now learned was called fr. dave. 

we entered the sitting room, which was surprisingly full of students! each wall was lined with chairs so there was about 20 students plus us, so this came as quite a relief as we honestly thought we were the only ones to have shown up. 

well the pancakes were glorious. there was a table packed with jars of nutella, honey, syrup, marshmallows, and cream. and i must say that was the best cup of tea i’ve had in a while. yes, it was all going great. then they started to talk about god. now i would’ve been perfectly okay with that, i would’ve went along with it out of politeness, if i knew anything about god or the bible.  we were sat in a circle and as we went around, we thanked god for something good in our lives, then we asked one another what our favourite part of the bible was. i have never read the bible, but it sure seems like an interesting book. yes, our little act was coming along quite nicely; we had thanked god for generic college related crap (like good grades or friends and such), we even managed to get through the bible part by making up some crap about not being able to choose the best part and bashfully smiling at the rest of the people present. but then came the prayer. 

of course (and this was also out of pure politeness, we did eat their pancakes after all) we awkwardly sat and kind of half mimed the prayers that we obviously didn’t know (i knew the our father from primary school but that was it). it was going pretty great, that is until one of my friends started getting looks from the guy across from her, as he had obviously copped that she was miming.

she threw a hissy fit. now, she didn’t scream or anything, but she did storm out of the room in a huff whilst saying something along the lines of “i’m not f*cking religious anyway, i just wanted free pancakes for f*ck sake”. now, in ireland, it is the norm to be polite to people, it is also the norm that one is to be very polite and courteous when one is a guest in someones house, and to also be extremely polite to priests. so obviously, you can see where this was going. 

to say we were embarrassed is an understatement. there was a second or two (it honestly felt like hours) when the rest of us just sat there, everyone staring at us, before we realised it was time to go, and fast. we booked it out of there, collected our bags, and headed toward the door, trying to thank the priest for his hospitality like nothing happened.

well it is once again tuesday, and we received another email. “free tacos”. my friend actually wants to go back there because she thought they were so nice and they would “surely understand if we explained our situation to them”. i’m not sure the tacos are worth it.
Response list: ['i got free pancakes at a house in ireland, and i was awkwardly miming the prayers of a priest, and i was embarrassed.']
Ground truth: was lured to a priest’s house with pancakes, got caught up in prayer because it turned out to be some christian union type deal and they thought we were christian. oh, and my friend pretty much cussed out a priest.

Input: Text: so, i have a little bit of social anxiety.  well, more than a little bit.  i have been doing fairly well recently at working on that, but this may have set me back somewhat.

i was on the train heading home from work, and it's about an hour's journey, so it is especially irritating when i have to listen to other people's music turned up too loud on the commute.  especially through buds that make it sound all tinny.  the guy sitting behind me had his music up quite loud, playing on his phone.  i think i may have misophonia, as certain sounds just agitate the shit out of me.  but normally the anxiety makes me suck it up and not say anything.

i tried my first tactic in such situations - put on my own headphones, which cover the ears and actually do a fairly decent job at blocking out all but the worst, even if i don't turn on any music myself.

i could still hear it quite loudly.  so i started playing a video on my laptop (through the headphones, of course!), but still i could hear this grating music over the top.

i'd seen the guy a lot on my train before.  he seemed a normal enough guy.  so (surprising myself) for probably only the third time in my life, i tapped the guy on the shoulder (he was behind, but sitting sideways), and said in the most polite voice i could muster "hey, can you please turn the music down a bit... it's quite loud... ...thanks".  he was engrossed in his sudoku game on the phone and did not respond.  i tapped again and as he turned to me, i again said "can you please turn the music down a bit... it's quite loud".

he stared straight into my soul with his black eyes.  and said nothing.  after what seemed like eternity, he said in a very controlled and deliberate manner "**really?**".  i was confused.  what kind of response was this?  my mind blanked on how to respond.  i tried to say something again and he cut me off with another "**really?**", then added a menacing "**just turn around**!".  again my mind blanked.  what the fuck?  i must have looked like i was going to say something, because he repeated that menacing "**turn around**!".  i noped out of this confrontation and tried to regain some dignity with a confused "*ooooooookkkkkkaaaaayyyy.....*" as i turned to face forward.

of course my anxiety and obsessive mind now have me trying to analyse this incident and work out just what i did wrong.  did i not sound as polite as i thought?  is it really that rude to ask someone to turn their music down a bit?  needless to say i won't be doing that again for a while...
Response list: ['i asked a guy on the train to turn down his music, and he just turned around.']
Ground truth: asked stranger to turn his music down, got death stare and bizarre aggressive response**

Input: Text: this actually happened yesterday but nevermind. 

my parents are both very religous, i am not so religous, trust me that's important to the story.

i was sat in the car with my dad and we were listening to a political podcast which was mainly just three people screaming at eachother about nigel farage.

and i said: "this isn't unlike the podcast i listen to, although they're screaming about dick jokes more than immigration." 

and my dad looked at me like i'd just said the worst thing you could possibly say ever. "dick jokes? do you think that's appropriate listening material?" he asked

"sure" i mumble, uncertainly. "why not? i mean it's normally just me sat in my room with headphones on, so none of you can get offended by them"

dad sighs and asks "do you think jesus listened to dick jokes?"

"yes sure, why not *i mean he had a penis right?*" i answer, still a little unsure of whether i'm digging too far.

"what so judas just said to jesus, 'hey, heard the one about the arab with the massive boner?' and also jesus didn't have a penis." my dad responsed.

me and my dad argued on this for the whole time we were in the car and have not spoken to eachother since, and it was about 24 hours ago.

Input: Text: last year of college i was violently ill with some variety of respiratory illness (probably the flu) -- sore throat, coughing, runny nose -- the usual unpleasantness. i was unable to eat very much other than applesauce, nyquil, and cough drops for about a week and i had begun to grow very hungry. 

one evening, my sore throat had begun to subside and i could once again eat solid food. unfortunately, i arrived about 30 minutes before my university's cafeteria closed and the only food remaining was fried chicken. i swiftly bought my box of nuggets and fries and walked back to my dorm room (i didn't have a roommate that year). i devoured my prize, washed it down with a carbonated beverage, and drifted off to sleep.

at precisely 3:00 a.m. the next morning i felt a prodigious urge to evacuate my bowels. "sweet merciful jesus", i exclaimed as i leapt from my lofted bed to frantically search for my shoes. bent over double, cloaked in darkness, my hands closed around my shoes at the very moment that my predicament went from bad to very fucking bad.

it was like a jackson pollock painting: the door, the walls, the cold, and formally gray, tile floor were completely covered. i stared in disbelief, a steady steam of expletives pouring from my mouth as a fetid odor permeated the room. i spent the better portion of an hour and the majority of my cleaning supplies disinfecting the room only to discover that it had leaked under my door and into the hall, and was turning a crescent-shaped section of the hall a rich, dark brown. 

after i finished cleaning i walked to the showers at the end of the hall and bathed -- all the while muttering, "how the fuck did that just happen". mid-way through my shower i hear a group of very inebriated girls enter the bathrooms (all bathrooms in my building were co-ed). when i finished showering i realized, to my horror, in my haste to get clean i brought only a bar of soap, my keys, and the soiled clothes i was wearing. i waited for a few minutes until i heard the cackling laughter of drunken girls exit the bathroom and fade away. i gathered my belongings and walked, butt naked, right into the same group of girls who were hanging out in the hallway talking.

Ground truth: -- i ate mostly nyquill and cough drops for a week, had some fried chicken, shit all over my dorm room, and then walked fully nude into a group of very drunk (and very attractive) women while clutching my shit-soaked tighty-whities.

Input: Text: much like many other fuckups mine was not today but in fact a long time ago. when i was about seven my mom took me to the mall for some shopping. after a while we were growing pretty hungry so we proceeded to procure some food from one of the vendors in the mall cafeteria. now, me being a small kid with an even smaller bladder needed to use the restroom after a longish excursion at the mall. attempting to find the restrooms i looked around to no avail. thus, i called upon the great wisdom of my mother as to where i could relieve myself. she, who's was distracted by something at the moment, pointed at the restrooms. however, from my vantage point, where she pointed was not towards a restroom, but instead a potted plant. confused, i asked her if she was sure that was the restroom. she nodded her head and proceeded to carry on doing whatever she was doing. now me, a obedient soldier, believed her every command, and so with complete faith in her directions i headed over to the plant..... and peed in it..... in front of about a hundred people who were also eating in said cafeteria. now and only now was it that my mother discovered her mistake when she looked up and saw my golden streams breathing life upon the plant... after that we basically left the mall, my mother in shame, me in confusion, and didn't come back for a loooooooong time.

Input: Text: like most of the posts here, this didn't actually happen today, instead it happened a couple of days ago.

a little bit of context: i'm a student, so of course money is always an issue. in order to deal with this, i have a part time job at a local cinema for minimum wage which just about covers my expenses. recently, there have been issues with the rota leaving us short staffed and in desperate need in cover.

so, i got a phone call saying that they desperately needed me to come in for a few hours to help out behind retail. so being the good little employee that i am, i obliged, figuring the little bit of extra cash couldn't hurt at the end of the month. 

everything was going fine, customers weren't complaining, popcorn was selling etc. until we had a break, where nothing was going to happen for a while; so i decided it'd be the perfect opportunity to check my phone and reply to any messages that i'd missed. now this is where i fuck up. once i'd finished using my phone, i go to put it back in my back pocket - where it normally lives when i'm working - but i miss, and it hits the floor and bounces a little. my heart skips a beat, but everything seems to be fine..phew.

but how i was wrong. slowly, little bits of purple started to appear on the screen, the calibration began to get a bit buggy, and the purple spread. turns out, that somehow, i'd cracked the lcd panel behind the screen. my phone quickly became unusable and i had to endure the bus home with no music.

the next day i visit the lovely people of samsung who say they can fix it. for a price. two hours and £180 later, my phone is fixed and my bank account is in negatives. as a student, this hurt, because as i mentioned at the start, my job only just covers my expenses.

so that reddit, is how i fucked up, hopefully you found this more entertaining than i did.
Response list: ['i got a call from the cinema, i went to work, my phone was cracked.']
Ground truth: went to work to help at short notice, karma betrayed me and now i'm more poor than ever before

Input: Text: obligatory this happened a couple of hours ago. i play in my college's pep band for basketball, and a major tournament for us is happening this week. i'm super stoked because i've been looking forward to traveling to play with the band for this tournament for like, i dunno, the past 2 months? 
well, anyway, we won the game tonight which means we advance to the next round (hurrah!). at the end of the game, my band director called us all down to talk to us about when we leave, what we need, etc. me, being really fucking excited (and tired from having stood for twoish hours straight), decided to hurry down the stairs. this next part felt like slow motion. i missed several steps, tripped on the bottom step, and landed on my back on the floor. of course, i'm laughing my ass off but several people, including my band director are asking me if i'm okay, helping me up, etc.
i didn't get out of this unscathed, i have a pretty sizeable bruise on my ankle now  and a small brush burn. definitely not my worst injury, and it could have ended worse. still, pretty embarrassing when you consider that hundreds of people saw it happen.

Input: Text: so this was back in the summer of 2012. i went to see the almighty maiden in clarkston, mi and got some decent seats around the 5th or 6th row. as soon as i got there, i started making some small talk with a group sitting to my left, who came from the french speaking part of canada to see the band perform. i threw around some of the little french i knew and we talked about our favorite iron maiden songs, etc.  

fast forward to the ending of the concert. now, if you've been to one of these rock concerts, you know that at the end, the musicians will just start throwing their guitar picks and drumsticks to the crowd. well, the moment arrived and me and my new french speaking friends were really trying to grab anything that was thrown our way. another detail is that while i am more of a casual listener of iron maiden, they were huge fans. they were desperate, i was more of "it'd be cool to get something".

another detail is that it is not uncommon for picks to get thrown and not get caught by anybody. so as this fan frenzy is going on around us, the guy to my left decides to search for picks under the seats in front of us. at this moment, i see the drummer, nicko mcbrain, has brought out some signed drum heads and is throwing them into the crowd. since this venue has these chairs that are bolted to the ground with a retractable seating part, i decide to climb up onto the stationary part, rise above the crowd and reach for one of those coveted drum heads.

with one foot on the bolted part of the chair and the other on the reclined seating part, my balance was not the best and so i didn't have much time. despite this, nicko sees me. yes! he'll surely frisbee a drum head my way! success! oh wait...no, he's turning around to make a joke as if i was looking at something behind him...

wait, there's more. what's this? one of the security people comes to tell me i couldn't climb the seats and need to get down from where i was. cool, i understand them doing their job... but the guard told me with both words and a slight tug.

yep. you guessed it. i lost my balance and fell forward. not a problem, as i was landing on my feet... just not on the floor... remember when i said the guy beside me was looking for picks under the seats in front? i landed with not one, but both feet on his back. i could hear the loud gasp from this guy, who got up immediately. i swore he was going to punch my daylights out right there and then for using him as a skateboard. 

luckily, he didn't. i apologized profusely and he was visibly shaken, but let it go thankfully. and so we all walked out of the venue, empty handed...
Response list: ['i got a drum head thrown at me, i fell down, and i got a drum head thrown back at me.']
Ground truth: went to maiden concert. guy beside me crouched to find guitar picks on the floor, i climbed on the seats to get stuff. lost my balance, fell forward and stomped on the guy's back like mario stomping a goomba.

after lunch i'm sitting in my car playing wiiu, finishing my baha blast when i go to fart and baha blast my pants. see i'm out of cash and just been using my credit card. it seemed logical in my position to only eat once a day too. so taco bell after not eating with my stomach = poo in the pants. but it's like you have lots of iffy farts... you gotta check. so i stick my finger in my pants and pull it out covered in liquid shit. lucky i already have water proof seat covers. and i had a towel close by to put under me. but now i have to drive, one hand with shit on it, to a discreet bathroom.

the partly good thing about living in a car is i'm accustom to getting cleaned up in random bathrooms, and i have it all with me. the bad part is no parking near this bathroom. so, i have to walk 100 ft in front of 6 cars worth of people in the park... trying to hold my backpack awkwardly over my shame. finish my liquid shit in the port o john. and break out the wet wipes...

Input: Text: this happened around 2 months ago at school. my friend and i were throwing a football around and everything was going well. he said he was going to throw a bullet pass, which means any sane receiver is going to throw 2 hands up to catch it. not yours truly though, i was going to one hand this pass. it was a perfect spiral throw, i put out my hand and wham! the ball flies behind me and i feel an intense pain in my thumb. it bent backwards when the ball hit it. i knew immediately it was a sprain. i continued playing football after a quick break to let the initial pain subside. it hurt to move for a few weeks and i re-aggravated it a couple of times but it eventually healed for the most part. however, it still hurts a little and pops when i tuck my thumb in my fist or when i bend it back at a certain angle so i may have a completely torn a ligament and now caused permanent damage because i thought it was too minor to see a doctor.

Input: Text: so like most tifu's, this didn't happen today but a few months ago. 

i was walking my dog around the block and since i live really close to the beach, my street is full everyday in the summer. it's not uncommon for me to get stopped by people asking for directions or guys cat calling me so i usually think nothing of it.

as i near the corner back to my house, a man in this nice ass brand new car motions/calls me over. so i go there and it's this big sexy black man and sitting in the passenger seat is this girl next door type white girl. off the bat i could tell they have money. she was wearing a nice dress and a diamond necklace and he was dressed well. so he starts talking about how he loves my hair (white girl with dreads) and then he starts getting a little weird. i could tell he was drunk or off the shits. he says "you can never be with a white man, know why??" and i'm like uhh and he goes "you would confuse him lookin like that. you need a black man in your life. i can find you a black man. come around and see my son. i want you to see my zebra baby". yes. zebra baby. at this point i keep telling him i'm going home but he keeps telling me what to do and like the naive girl that i am, i listen. so i go around and they both get out the car. he leaves his door open and opens the back door so i could see his toddler. he tells me to touch his hair and feel his dreads so i do. he tells me he can get me a man to make a zebra baby with. and then he goes "kiss him on the cheek". and i'm like uhh... so i pinch his cheek. and he goes "no kiss him on the cheek" in this stern ass voice so i do. i kissed a random toddler on the cheek. so then this guy is all happy and he's like "i like her baby get her number" so this lady whips out her brand new iphone. i give her my real number and she calls it right away since my phone is in my hand. at this point i'm like i really got to go home and he makes me give them hugs and i leave. like an idiot, i walk right into my house which is right across the street. 

so when i get inside i'm like wtf happened that was so weird. i look up the area code of the number and its from new mexico. i dont live anywhere near new mexico. so the next day when i go to school i tell my class about this funny incident and they laugh but are all like wtf is wrong with you why didn't you leave. and my teacher with this dumbfounded look on his face goes "that is exactly how every story of human trafficking starts." and immediately everything clicks. i don't know how i didn't understand that this was a pimp who wanted to sell me despite the fact that he told me straight up he could find me a black man to make zebra baby's with. i'm an idiot.

it was a typical spring day, and i was in middle school, sitting in class and talking to a friend. i don't remember the details, but he told me a joke that i found extremely funny. for some odd reason, i responded to his joke by laughing hysterically and ended up whipping my head in a downward motion towards the desk where a mesh binder was placed. i had braces at the time, so they somehow ended up getting caught in some of the lacing of the mesh binder. the binder was something like this : http://cheapbinderstores.blogspot.com/2013/05/case-it-velcro-closure-2inch-ring-binder.html

Input: Text: so i live in a hostel room with a roommate. i cash out amount of 500 from atm because my friend needed it. he returns after he is able to. now i have 500 cash that should be in my atm but is in my wallet now. too lazy and busy to go to bank to deposit it.
i am going outside on a trip and feel 500 cash in my wallet is too risky as i might lose it if my wallet gets stolen. our drawers and cupboard don't have any locks so trying to figure out where to put the money. after much thinking, have this brilliant idea to hide it in one of random envelopes in my drawer. that way even if someone looks inside my drawer, they can't find it unless they open all the envelopes, also please note the drawer is very messy with all sorts of useless things in there so envelopes don't stand out. 
i come back from trip, all is well, time passes by. recently after two months, discovered the hidden 500 cash, and i'm like when did i hide this note here? i make a mental note to use that cash late. leave it there now.
week later, i'm running out of cash, remember i had that 500 in that envelope. open drawer, look for the envelope, can't find it. search all the envelopes, every single thing. can't find it. then memory immediately flashes back to week earlier when i was cleaning my room. the drawer was open and i think i took the envelope and without fucking checking it and threw it in the trash can. i didn't check because all envelopes were useless . now, i am all sad that i lost 500 because of my carelessness, laziness and stupidity.

Input: Text: okay, so, for context: my family was dog-sitting for another family while they were away. instead of driving 35 minutes to their house and back 2-3 times a day, we decided to just keep the dog at our house. their dog is a young, havanese-shi-tsu mix (i think). his name is loki. and he is a devil dog.

okay, time for the story:

so, the entire family, human and canine alike, was in my parents' room talking (i don't remember about what). well, loki kept jumping on the bed. we told him to get off. we wouldn't mind, normally, but he just *would not* leave us alone. it was getting annoying, so we sent him out of the room and closed the door.

mistake #1. he gets seperation anxiety. you can't even leave the room without him or he'll start whining. so of course, that's what he did.

well, eventually, i decided to head to my room (next door). my brother, parents, and the other dogs were still in the master bedroom. i didn't want to deal with loki at the moment, so i closed my door as well.

mistake #2. about 30 seconds after i did so, he started barking. eventually, i got fed up with hearing it, so i opened my door to let him in, and just hoped he would ignore me.

mistake #3. apparently, my dog, jake, had also gotten out of my parents' room. i don't know how. before i could really register, he had wandered into my room.

now, normally, this wouldn't be a problem. however, loki is territorial/food aggressive. we had been keeping a crate there for feeding/sleeping. because of the conflict of interests, we had been trying to keep the other two out of my room.

jake, being curious about the new addition to my room since the last time he had been in there, decided to investigate the crate.

loki had a problem with that.

he started out growling and barking, and of course, i tried telling him no and calming him down, while simultaneously pulling jake from the room.

in seconds, however, he had escalated to full-on attacking him.

jake, of course, fought back. 

my first instinct was to try and separate them. pulling their harnesses didn't work, being loud didn't work, pushing them away from each other by the chest didn't work, so, my last resort was to just stand between them until they stopped.

it worked, but not before loki gave me a nasty gash from his claw (seriously, those things need trimmed. they are *deadly*).

of course, when i did this, i wasn't worried about my dog's chances in the fight. jake is a golden retriever, and he's big, even for one of those. he's got a good, strong bite (i learned this from playing tug-of-war with him). needless to say, he's fairly capable of defending himself. so no, i wasn't worried about saving him from this dog.

i was worried about saving the other dog from him.

you see, he doesn't normally get aggressive. in fact, in the 2+ years i've had him, he hasn't so much as snarled at anyone. the most aggressive thing he's done is chase a cat, and if he actually caught one, i highly doubt he'd actually kill it. this week, however, he's been aggressive 3 times, including this incident, all directed towards loki. he apparently got just as fed up as the rest of us, because, while the first two times, he just growled and snapped at him for a second or two, this time, he didn't stop.

so yeah. i can post a picture, if people want to see the gash. if it scars, it'll look really cool.

 

edit: by the way, if you have a dog, or are thinking about getting one, please, please, *please,* do not baby them. they will turn into aggressive, entitled little jerks.

edit 2: someone asked for the picture, so [here](https://m.imgur.com/account/halfging3r/images/q25aw3t) it is.
Response list: ["my dog, loki, got a nasty gash from his claw on my brother's chest."]

as a young kid i was very adventurous, always looking for something new to do or to plat with. i was very interested in fire and trains, two things you shouldn't mix. anyway, my neighbour had this train set, a massive one, that was spread through their entire garage. it was all set up, the train would have tunnels and bridges and it was amazing. or so i thought. me being me bugged my parents for months to buy me one but they never would as it was always about money and how much things would cost etc etc. i really wanted to use the train set my neighbours had.

this is where the **fu** happens. 

my neighbours went out one afternoon but ended up leaving their garage open. i seized this opportunity and entered the garage to fulfill my 10 yr old selfs dream of using this train set. like i said, i was very interested in fire as well. so after playing with the set for a while, i saw a pack of matches lying a few meters away from the set, not sure why it was there. i decided to put some newspaper in one of the carriages and set it on fire to replicate coal burning. i know coal doesn't burn there now. anyway a few moments after doing this the carriage falls off the track, little 10 yr old me just freaks out and runs.

the entire garage ends up going up in flames and i think it spread to a bit of the house. to this day no one knows it was me although i feel my parents have suspicions. my neighbours had to replace everything in the garage and they ended up moving houses.

Response list: ['i set a carriage on fire and it spread to the whole house.']
Ground truth: ** snuck into neighbour's house, played with their train set. set a carriage on fire, carriage fell over. i ran. garage went up in flames.

Input: Text: this is the story of how at only 12 years old, i committed a felony.


i was on a cruise ship, and i was hanging out in the arcade at around 12:30 a.m, bored out of my mind. i was with my cousin, and neither of us had any tickets left, and our parents cut off our spending. i found a ticket on the floor, and as a joke decided to jam it in the prize machines receipt slot. then, i printed a receipt for one ticket to try to push it out. when that didn't work, i finally got it out with my finger, and two receipts came out, each for one ticket. i was confused, then realized, i had just cloned a ticket!
   

i later figured out how it works. when i printed out the receipt, i blocked it from coming out. the machine doesn't realize it came out, so it lets you print another one, and then you clone those tickets too.
  

i then proceeded to use this to my advantage, buying out a bunch of prizes. i also let some of the other kids in the arcade in on it, and we basically emptied the prize machine. after that, everything started to fall apart.  
 

 more and more kids started to find out, and would do it right in front of the arcade staff. when the staff started noticing something was going on, they started paying more attention. at one point, i noticed one recording me on his phone, and i ran away as fast as i could. i would see them standing next to the machines all day, watching every kid carefully. i saw one machine open, and the guy was trying to fix it. i found out from a friend that they had caught some kid with a receipt for 300,000 tickets, when the most expensive prize was 2,500 tickets. the guy said to him, "hey, that's illegal, kid." and took him to their office.
  

  i avoided the arcade after that, but it was too late. when me and my family were coming back on to the ship from nassau, they were scanning our cards. they scanned mine, and the screen read, 'denied'. a crew member brought me to the cruise ship directors office, or whoever it is that runs the jail. he said to me, "we know what you did." i thought they might be bluffing, and acted confused. but then he took out a receipt for 300,000 tickets, and i realized i was done for. 


he told me what he had found out, and he said this. "so,  what we know is, one kid found a glitch in the machine, and he started showing people how to do it. and then he showed you, is that correct?". i realized i had a way out and said, "yes, that's right. that kid started the whole thing. a lot of the kids didn't know how he did it, he just gave them prizes and tickets." 
  

 the director made me return my prizes and tickets, and said that if i ever went back to the arcade, they would contact authorities. some of the other kids involved thanked me for not throwing them under the bus. i later found out the so-called "ringleader" was charged with a felony. they never found out that it was me.

update: i found an old journal entry, and apparently the director told me that we racked up 1.3 million tickets from the glitch. i remembered one of the toys, a remote control robot, cost 2000 tickets, and i did the math. i could have gotten 650 robots, and each robot sells for $20, so we potentially could have taken $13,000 worth of toy robots.
Response list: ['i cloned a ticket, and then used it to buy out a bunch of prizes. i let kids know how to do it, and they all got caught.']
Ground truth: i found a glitch in an arcade machine that gave me free tickets. shit got serious, and i avoided getting charged with a felony, but threw some other kid under the bus for it.

Input: Text: i am an overnight sitter for an elderly woman who lives in an assisted living apartment building. some nights after she's gone to bed, i walk down the hall to a nice screened in porch area to smoke a cig or 2 and call my boyfriend, play pokémon, browse reddit, etc. as it's screened in, i usually bring a cup to ash in and collect butts. last night, i had a half full mini water bottle in my bag and decided that would be much easier than using a cup, dumping the cup in the toilet, cleaning out the cup. all went well and as expected, it was a much easier and contained method. i didn't want to throw the bottle away in the room and risk anyone finding it, (my old lady has dementia and i often find her digging in trashcans) so i put the bottle back in my bag to discard on my way out in the morning. i opened my bag this morning to the enticing smell of old wet cigarettes. i hadn't sealed the bottle correctly, and the ash filled water had leaked onto my clothes, bra, shoes, and other sleepover essentials all night. it was nasty. so, for the rest of my shift i had to walk my old lady to breakfast and on her morning walk in my pajamas, braless, with damp cigarette shoes on. you know when someone walks in the room and you know that they must smoke in their bed with the windows and doors shut because they smell like a hundred ashtrays? that was me today at this very nice, expensive dorm for old people. 

on a happy note, it has prompted me to try to quit smoking again, and i passed up on buying another pack when i ran out today. silver linings, right?

Input: Text: so this happened last year and i figured it might be a pretty good one to put on here.

my mom and dad are separated, but both still lived in the same town. my mom had just had some of the branches on her trees trimmed and was asking me if i could go drop them off at my dads in his backyard, since he was just going to use them for a bonfire. at the time, i was driving my dad's little old 87 ford ranger, so i loaded up the branches and drove over to my dad's house.

now, my dad's backyard is a huge sinkhole, but it's sloped enough that you can drive down around the edge of it and get to the bottom. he keeps all his firewood down at the bottom for bonfires, which is where i was taking the branches. so i drive the ranger into the backyard up on the high point, and open up the tailgate, and then stop and think,
"you know, i don't really feel like dragging these down, i think i'll just drive the truck down and drop them off and then drive it back up."

this was back when i was a little ignorant to driving off-road, and it had just been raining for the past two days and everything was muddy. so i drive the ranger down the slope of the sinkhole, drop off the branches, and then try to drive it back up. it's stuck. i sit there and spin the tires trying to get it to move, and it's totally buried in the rear now. i kinda start getting a little nervous, i tried putting a lever force on the axle with a bigger branch to get it out, putting branches under the wheels to give it traction, but to no avail. so i'm stuck at the bottom of a 100 foot sinkhole with an old ranger and no way of getting it out. 

then i had a brilliant idea. i could get my dad's brand new f150 and pull it out. he wouldn't be home for another two hours or so and if i got it out with the f150, we're golden. so i climb back up the sinkhole and go get the f150 and some tow straps. i put it in four wheel drive and everything, go down, and before i can even get it in position to hook up to the ranger, it's stuck too. i start freaking out. i call my mom and tell her what's going on and she comes over and tries to help but it's no use. looks like i'm just going to have to call dad.

i call my dad and he starts screaming at me. "you did what? i wouldnt even drive the ranger down there when its dry. its been raining for two days, hell why dont you just go drive the mustang down there too?" etc. it was very unpleasant. 

i spend the next two hours until he gets home trying to drive the f150 out, but it's only sliding deeper into the hole at this point and i'm not helping it any. 
my dad eventually got home and drove the f150 out by itself and then pulled the ranger up the hill with it.  i wasn't allowed to help with any of this because he was so mad at me he just told me to go inside.

moral of the story: laziness, might actually lead to working a lot harder than simply putting in the effort to do it the right way.
Response list: ["i tried to drop off firewood from my dad's house, and it ended up being buried in a sinkhole."]
Ground truth: i drove my dad's ranger into a sinkhole to drop off some branches instead of carrying them down like i should have and got it stuck. i tried driving the f150 down next and got it stuck too. dad was not happy.

my mom and her longtime boyfriend broke up, so mom decided it was time to clean up her room to get rid of all the memories that could go away and move on with her life.  during the process, she put all the things she wanted to keep in a few garbage bags to keep them separate from the "bad" stuff.  these things included all of our school pics/report cards, family pics, keepsakes, etc.

my mom worked midnights, and we were out until it got dark of course, and for some reason she thought putting these bags of our lives at the front door.  me being the energetic and ever so helpful person that i was, i decided to put the garbage out that day.  i'm sure you can figure out the rest from here.

i ask alex what she got. she said she got the ursa major constellation and i sat and pondered for about 5 seconds and asked alex if that was the bear one. she said yes and i was trying to imagine how that could be done. she asks my so to show it to me. in my head i'm like "ez, it'll look like a bear with lines and shit."

wrong, horribly wrong. it's some half assed connect the dot bullshit with like two really big hack jobs of "brighter stars" and some other garbage. i kinda twisted my face up in a way that said "wtf" and she immediately noticed.

alex says "what the fuck was that?" and i was like "what?" she said "the look on your face. it was kinda shitty." and i was like "oh." then she gets super defensive and is trying to bait me into arguing with her and i say "nothing. never mind." finally she gets pissy, starts throwing shit and just recently stormed out of the room.

also i think it's worth mentioning that she was already regretting it but the quality of the tattoo caught me off guard and it resulted in this.

now my so is begging me to apologize and try to make up with her because she's going to be gone for 6 hours tomorrow.

i don't know why i did it, i'm not normally a prejudiced jackhole. i was picked on as a kid and i know how it hurts to be made fun of. but nonetheless, on an impulse born of pure dickheadedness, i leaned in and quietly said to my friend sitting across from me, "hey, check out the midget over there."

her back was to this little person and her friends. when my friend heard "over there" it didn't occur to her that it could possibly mean "directly fucking behind you" cause she loudly and enthusiastically turned around exclaiming, "ooh! a midget! where?!"

Input: Text: you know how people always say "don't miss leg day?" yeah, that shit is true. do not miss leg day.

so i've been doing p90x3 for a while and my body is starting to get used to working out. but, like everyone else, the main reason i'm doing the program is to have a rockin' bod. and so i focus my efforts on the muscles that will help that image. pecks, biceps, triceps, shoulders, abs, etc. the last thing on my mind is my lower half, so i skipped workouts dealing with those muscle groups.

so at about halfway through this program i took pictures to see my progress from day one. i wasn't expecting much, but i was surprised that i could see a bit of difference. after poppin' chub for the new me, i realized that i had become a bit of a monster. i was gaining definition up top, but my legs retained that chicken look. 

naturally, i wanted to resolve this issue and i decided tonight would be the best time to really lay on the leg workouts. squats. lunges. kicks. other leg things. you name it, i did it. and by god, i could feel that it was working. my legs were quivering with this work and i was proud.

this is where things go south.

i walked upstairs to take my post-workout shower. it was difficult to get up the two flights of stairs, which was odd, but i didn't pay it any mind. i started the shower and hopped inside.

the warm water felt like liquid jesus and i stood there thinking i was hot shit. everything from singing to myself to doing poses in my shower mirror. not my proudest moment. after being a little narcissistic bitch, i looked down and saw my member could use a haircut.

you see where this is going.

i picked up the razor like it was fucking excalibur and went to town. keep in mind i'm on an endorphine high from exercising and my judgment is not at its peak by this point. 

my legs start to randomly spasm as a reaction to heavy use and the violent shaking causes me to slice my scrotum. i screamed like a child as drops of blood fell to the shower floor.

so now i have a family that is now awake, a bleeding scrotum, and legs that won't stop shaking. fan-fucking-tastic.

i gotta admit, when the immediate pain subsided, my first thought wasn't to seek help or fix my bloodied penis, it was "this might make a decent tifu." i am ruined. i need to relax on the redditing.

so i patch up my cock and assure parents that i am fine. it could have been much worse, but it still stings like hell. typed this bad boy up and now i'm gonna sleep it off. who knows, mini me might be okay for a morning round if i'm lucky. jk

in our first physics class of the semester, my friends and i go sit at the back of the lecture hall, where roughly 600 students would attend.  as we sit, i spot a girl (let's call her megatron) who attended primary school with me and one of my friends (let's call him goku), as she is coming into the hall way at the front.  i ask the friend next to me (let's call him unintentionalloser), who didn't attend the same primary school, to pass on the message to goku that he should check it out, it is megatron from primary school.

meanwhile, goku is in conversation with someone, and unintentionalloser is just being polite, waiting for him to finish before relaying the message.  and, as murphy dictated, megatron strolled up all the way, past all the open chairs, and ends up sitting *right* in front of us.  this is perfectly in time with goku finishing with his engaging conversation.

Input: Text: recently my dad decided i shouldn't live with him anymore, and i decided to move in with my mom. by the way, my parents are divorced, but both are remarried. i drove over to my dads today to pick up a light that i made in school when i was younger, but it was my favorite thing in my room. i never told my dad when i was coming over to get it, and i think you can already assume what happens here. as i went to unlock the door, i heard a loud shriek. i opened the door to probably the most disturbing sight i've ever seen in my life. i really do think it was the worst possible moment in my life, and i feel like i'm suffering somewhat of ptsd now. of course right on the floor in my living room was my dad with a t-shirt on and no pants (and a full hard on, trust me not what i wanted to fucking see right after a long day of school), and next to him by now since they both panicked, was my step mom fully naked, out of breathe with one of my hawaiian shirts on that i left at the house, and sunglasses on. as my dad was trying to explain what happened, i ran to my room and left without saying a word. i have no idea if my dad has some sort of fetish for dressing up for the beach or something but now i know to not go back for the shirt at some point.
Response list: ['i was going to get a light from my dad, and he was trying to explain what happened, and i ran to my room and left without saying a word.']

Input: Text: by today i mean several years ago.

i was 10-11 years old and i loved biking. i had just gotten a new bike for my birthday, and it was a huge upgrade from the bike i had before. this new one shifted gears, and had two brakes! so cool!

it was a couple days after my birthday, and i was out riding my bike.  my parents thought i was smart enough to ride on the opposite side of cars on the road, which i was, so they allowed me to ride on the road nearby our house. (we live in a rural area, so barely any cars pass through here anyway) i had found out a while earlier that if you press the front brake you stop quicker , which is nice (i had only tested this going slowly). my house has large hills near it, both on the road and off, and i was having fun riding down those. it was great, until i found myself going down a hill faster than i intended to, quickly accelerating towards a wall of trees.

i tried the front brake trick and surprise surprise, and i was catapulted off my bike as it bounced right over my head and careened into the trees. i was lying there on the ground (thankfully grass) about 10 feet away from the trees, with blood all over my face and arms. i wasn't too far from my house, maybe a minute's walk at most. my juvenile mind tried to comprehend what just happened but i think i was too distracted by all the blood.

i eventually got off the ground, crying and shaking, and went to look at the bike. my brand new bike i had gotten a few days prior was bent, missing the seat, had a huge dent in the front rim, and the chain wasn't mounted (wrong word?) i got back to my house around 10 minutes after i crashed,  blood dripping from my arms and face, and my parents were scared shitless by the sight. thankfully my mom was a nurse and was able to clean and bandage me up, and the injuries weren't too bad, just a lot of scrapes.
Response list: ['i got a new bike, tried to ride it on the road, and it broke down.']
Ground truth: i pressed only my front brake while going down a hill, i was catapulted over the handlebars, and went home covered in blood with a broken bike.

Input: Text: hello, this is my first tifu post and i am currently typing this on my phone at work.

so last night i went to bed early knowing i had to wake up at 5 to get ready for work today. now i am not a morning person and i do get cranky if i am waken up before i am suppose to be. so then, last night at 2 a.m. i am waken up by a noise of chatter that grew louder and louder within each second outside my window. at this point i am deciding whether or not i should go check.

30 seconds later i am angry and go check what the hell is going on outside my window. i see a group of guys in the dark (like 10 of them) at 2am outside my window. then i hear the front door of my house open and i knew it was my sister and that those were all her friends standing outside my window waiting for her to open the door that leads into my basement.  ( probably to pary)

at this point i am furious with the obnoxious talking outside my window late at night. i am also very protective for my sister when i see a group of guys like that hanging out with her.

i come to the window and bang it as loud as i can to try to get them to shut up. they did for about 10 seconds. and then it grew loud again. i am very angry. 

i walk out of my room to confront my sister about the situation. at this point the whole house is woken up. i see my sister and shes asks me if i want to join her downstairs when she knows i have work in 2 hours. i flip out and and start to stomp the floor yell at her. i then punch the nearest thing next to me which was the wall. i punched it harder than i thought and it left a gaping hole in it. my parents were there and saw the whole thing in the dark. as soon as they heard he loud bang my hand left they knew what i had done to their precious walls. i then angrily walk back to my room to try to get any sleep. my parents tell my sister to send her friends home.

i left for work before my parents wake up. i know they are pissed because of what i did to their wall. my shift doesnt end until 3 hours where i have to face them.
Response list: ["i bang my sister's window at 2am and it left a gaping hole in my parents' walls."]
Ground truth: :  woke up by my sister's obnoxious friends in the middle of the night . got angry and punched a hole in the wall of my parents house. about to get a death sentence.

Input: Text: i'm using a throwaway for this for reasons that will be obvious by the end. 

my eldest child is autistic and entering puberty. she has a mechanical and detached way of thinking and this has made some aspects of sex education kinda challenging, as anything emotional tends to go over her head because she needs more clinical answers to get it.

i have this old iphone 3 that i formatted and set up for my kids to use for their youtube videos about minecraft, netflix watching but she uses it the most. one afternoon when i couldn't find my phone and needed to search for something i picked that one up, and as i began typing all her recent searches came up and they were all things like, "redtube" and "sex" and "two people having sex". neither my spouse nor i believe in snooping: privacy is important, especially when it comes to puberty and teenage years, but we also really don't want her poking around on hard core porn sites at this stage of her life.

she admitted to the searches when asked and wanted to understand more about what pornography was and why it existed. i was as honest and open with her questions as i could be, one of which was, "why is it not ok for kids to see it if you want to know what sex looks like?". i realized then that she'd wanted to know what sexual organs and bodies in the act of sex looked like. there was no titillation involved, just plain curiosity, and she had a hard time grasping what was so wrong about it if there were also books with drawings of sexual organs and depictions of sex in them that are specifically for teaching it to kids like her. that one was more complicated but i did my best. a long conversation of laws and maturing and boundaries really came down to, "a child your age should not be viewing adult bodies having sex, particularly pornography which isn't real sex at all" and that seemed to satisfy her. to be totally honest, i felt a little lost and wished i'd had more time to prepare a better speech but i was pretty confident i'd done a good job addressing it.

about a week later the same situation happened again with the old phone, but this time the search bar popped up things like, "aang sex", or "12 year old naked" and i immediately had a complete mental breakdown. all i could think about was the fbi raiding my house and seizing all our electronics and finding some sort of cache of child pornish sounding searches and getting added to a sex offender registry because i had inadvertently told my autistic child that she should limit her curiosity to something more age-appropriate and she took that way, way too literally.
Response list: ["i told my autistic child that she shouldn't see adult bodies having sex, and she took that way too literally."]
Ground truth: i am a horrible parent.

i decided i would like a refreshing can of pepsi, and the closest place to get it is at the vending machine in my student accommodation. the last row was the one filled with pepsi cans, and the first two slots in the row were empty, so i decided to go for the third one. being the programmer that i am, i count 0, 1, 2, put in my pound, and push the button for the last row, slot 2. trembling with anticipation of pepsi i look at the slot in the vending machine -the empty slot makes a movement releasing nothingness, and the vending machine eats up my money.

\*facepalm\*

 

context for the uninitiated: most programming languages work in such a way that it forces you to start counting from 0 instead of 1. so for example if a is a list of things, a[0] would be the first item in the list, a[1] the second and so on.
Response list: ["i tried to get pepsi from a vending machine, and it didn't work."]
Ground truth: started counting from 0, robbed by vending machine.

i broke my foot last weekend and have been on crutches for a few days. the doors at my workplace are extremely difficult to open in most places, and are typically unlocked by a little electric fob. this means i've got about 5 seconds to get to the door and get it open before the electric locks re-engage. my typical strategy is to swipe my fob, reposition my crutches, and then launch myself at the door in the hopes of applying enough force to open it before it locks again. 

i guess i've gotten in the habit of tackling doors open, because i was headed into the bathroom and opened the door by flinging myself into it. one of my coworkers was preparing to leave by that door at that exact moment. the door hit him in square in the face, and i collapse into the bathroom due to the unexpected resistance, and we both go down in a tangle of pain and crutches. it almost broke his glasses (he managed to bend them mostly back into shape), and he'll probably have a large linear bruise on his cheek and forehead tomorrow. 

at least i have the crutches for sympathy - i just pretended that i fell.

was heading down to my parents house to visit. stopped by kfc to get something to eat and get back on the interstate. as i’m trying to get back on, there’s a line of cars, all with hazard lights on, driving 30/40 on a 70mph road. i’m barreling down the on-ramp at 65mph trying to fin d a place to merge into traffic, but they’re all driving so close to each other. the car in front of me had to pull off to the side of the road because there’s no room left, but i see my chance! i step on the gas and cut two cars off to fleet ahead of these pack of weirdos. i look behind me and see most of them have stopped and the people in the on-ramp are heading on behind me. i feel like a savior that the people needed, but didn’t deserve! good job diddy!

as i’m flying by this 1 mile+ line of cars i’m thinking they’re all stupid for driving so slow. there’s no accident anywhere. no construction! i’m laughing at them when i decide to look at my phone and google “line of cars with their hazard lights on”. first thing that pops up is [this](https://www.funeralwise.com/learn/procession/) website. my laughter and jokes stop as i look up and see two hummer limos and a hearse. i finally got to the end of the car line and see he lead vehicle with the flags and hazard lights.

to the funeral procession i broke! i’m sorry, tifu!

Input: Text: happened like a hour ago.  so as a young college student with an overwhelming sex drive i jerk off at least once a day.  normally im super careful about this and make sure that no one is in the house and that my door is closed in case anyone does come home at the time.  today however i have the house to myself and as such didn't really care about anything so i loaded up a good old chinese cartoon porno and just started to go at it.

recently however my dog has been spending an enormous amount of time with me since i am the only one home between 12pm to like 10pm.  this hasnt really been a problem before now so i did not even think about it before i started going ham.  

so here i am getting on with it watching the chinese cartoon characters go at it while stroking and i can tell it is almost time for it to end.  so i start feeling it and then here comes my dog just fucking staring at me as i'm about to finish.  i try to wave her off but to no avail she decided that the best place to be was on my fucking lap as i'm about to finish.  

i finish dog is covered in my special sauce and she runs the fuck away before i can grab her to throw her in the bath and wash her off.  so now i'm chasing my dog around the house trying to get her in the bath when she discovers my father left his door open as well so she jumps on his bed and starts rolling around on it.  great now the sheets need to be washed as well.  

i finally catch the little bitch and throw her in the bath to get her all cleaned up and here she is fucking looking incredibly happy and i'm miserable.

Input: Text: alright first off i'd like to point out i don't gift much especially to a girl, but today was different. i am also the kind of person that if i try something and it went bad, i will not do it again. this happened today by the way. let's begin!!

apologies in advance for long post.

backstory! so i guess i should of seen this coming in the first place. christmas eve, she asks me one question i will never forget (because it freaked me out), "so, what are you giving your crush for christmas?" (did i mention she knows and has a boyfriend... long story for another day my friends)  i had no words other than the ones in my head "oh fuck". so i really didn't know what she wanted for christmas, so i ask pathetically. (by pretending to be santa of course!) and basically got a good list of what she wanted. couldn't mess anything up right? wrong! first off i couldn't give her a gift until sometime after christmas. (today to be exact).

on the list had some standard stuff, movies, food and such but i didn't want to give those. so being the classy guy i try to be i saw that on the list she wanted a bracelet and i'm like cool can't possibly mess this up! (wrong again my friend). my plan was after i am done visiting family from all over i come back buy her a bracelet. well then my head starts to spin. she has a boyfriend... can't make this too serious. so i buy a fast food card (we both work fast food and i know she is sick of it) only a 5 dollar amount. after that nice save. i'm like ok time to buy it i guess. (let the fucking up begin). i run in run out bam nothing awkward happens. after i walk out of the store though... i immediately have a buyers remorse, but it wasn't enough to turn me over and return it. now when i got home that's when it hit me. constantly just saying to myself "maybe just a movie would do." but what prevented me for changing was telling myself i'm terrible and second guessing myself. like most of the time i second it's bad. after that convincing thought i'm like this gift ain't that bad! and set off on a journey to fuck up island.

the journey was actually quite easy and smooth sailing, did some last minute changes with the present stuff and was going to give her the present right when she got off work. (in the back of my mind it was still a bad idea). so i give her the card. i had a good laugh at least. (i told her that's all i got her.) then comes the greatest blunder... the bracelet. i handed it to her and i start to feel a vibe of awkward in me. so i kinda shake it out and gave it. after when i gave it i realized the mess i made..she started to blush.. but not the thank you blush (at least i think). it was the oh you really shouldnt have blush. realizing this i pretty much played dumb. (luckily that is easy as i am sometimes clumsy at work). when i go to the break room i slap myself... just slap myself. 

i'm really tempted to say "oh i forgot to give you this movie (being the interview)". should i do that? i realize beyond a doubt it was a shite gift. or at least she did not like the style of the bracelet or i missed some thing when i bought it that she noticed.

 

if anything is misspelled, i didn't reread only because i typed this all on my phone.

edit: fixed some misspellings now that i am on a computer. edit2 formatting and updates

**more to the story** her day seemed to go well too actually, when i got there she was happy and laughing. she asked where was the gift (as the gift is very late) and i am like in my car... she didn't believe me and in my head i was like i will give it to her at the end of break. (should of just pretended i forgot) gave it to her, and that smiling face turned into redness... yup good job me!

**i will keep you guys updated about tomorrow if you want me too** (hoping for the best!)

update: more than likely she is coming in tomorrow, ill try to play it cool... (she might interrogate me though... we will see)

**update 1: just about an hour from going into work, freaking out but sticking with the plan. also i got a million scenarios in my head but no problem... again hoping for the best and i will try to keep you guys updated at work.**  

**update 2: at work let the fun begin**

**update 3: she is not her, but being the detective me. i look at the schedule and bam she is supposed to work today... she got her friend to go instead... umm there is only one other reason why she wouldn't be here but i won't say that here. now... if her friend asks or even mentions about the gift how should i react... cause i'll just say something on the lines of yeah i fucked up.**

**update 4: so after about a week, we haven't seen each other at work. we have been off and on at texting each other (mostly off) and she called me to take her spot on sunday. that wasn't a problem. i think she is busy in her life right now, and i don't think that we are not talking to each other just because of some stupid bracelet. we are working saturday and i think sunday. i will fill you in on the news when that comes around.
overall: no real drama, but at the same time less communication... (oh by the way i did not start texting her she came to me. so i guess that is a good sign. the bracelet couldn't of possibly been worse than her finding out i liked her... nervous laugh...)**

**update 5: ok little did i know but she is working today with me and it's actually been quite alright! i walk in, and start working and i was showing no signs of awkwardness about the whole situation (yaay i did something!). we are talking yada yada yada then boom... she says something about the christmas gift (joking about it but i didnt know.) i say something krass and she was like wooooooooow and i am wearing the bracelet! she pulls her sleeve up and behold she is wearing it! my jaw drops as i am unbeliever shocked that she is actually wearing that horrible present i got. there were no words on how surprised i was. after that little squabble we get back to work because all the cars on earth decoded to come to our freaking restaurant. after the masses get their food i get sent on break. so i say all is good right now.**

**update 6: probably going to be my last update... we will see! anyways we worked today and there is no hint of awkwardness (given we worked in the morning and it was super busy, and well im not really too energetic when i have to work in the morning). still need to work on my awkwardness though, but all is well. so i guess this whole problem was just a minor thing. hooray for minor fuck ups!**

Input: Text: alright guys, this happened last night, and i can't honestly live down how bad i fucked up. but it's kind of hilarious, so enjoy.

preface: i got into an argument with my stepmother. we bicker at one another, she tells me to get out, so i take a walk.

i get the bright idea to call this girl i've been talking to, with the intent of getting completely hammered and forgetting about my problems for a night. boy was i in for a treat. the girl (we'll call her m) answers, and doesn't mind me crashing for a night, so she picks me up.

we get to her place, and everything's going fine, except that i left my e-cig in her car (this is about to become very relevant). so we're cuddling, talking about stuff, enjoying each others company and downing white russians like it's no ones business, when i get the bright idea to go to her car and grab my e-cig. she hands me the keys and says to hurry.

the fuck up: i hadn't eaten all day, and my stomach decided it was going to give me a very rude awakening. halfway down the hall to the elevator, everything goes black. after getting back in my senses as of an hour ago, apparently i:

 - blacked out in the hallway

 - woke up to the security officer asking how i got in here, who i was staying with, what was i doing laying in the middle of a hallway

 - security officer tells me to "speak english" because i started trying to speak russian (i don't speak russian at all)

 - tells me m doesn't live here (even though i just walked out of her apartment 5 minutes beforehand)

after that fiasco, he throws me in cuffs and says he's getting a patrol car. i'm out of my senses, so i tell him to go fuck himself. patrol car gets there, (and thank god i got a cool cop,) and the cop asks me if i live with my parents after running my id. i was coherent enough to say i did. he calls my dad, explains the situation, tells dad he won't charge me with drunk and disorderly if he comes and gets me (at 5am...), aaaaaaaaaaaaand i black out again.

i woke up an hour ago, in my parents house. i have no shoes because i left them at m's place, as well as my magic cards. m is being surprisingly cool about the whole ordeal, despite the fact that i have her keys still.

needless to say, i'm sticking to beer from now on.

Input: Text: this happened a few days ago. my stomach had been hurting most of the day, which is unusual, and was getting a little worse so i headed upstairs to visit the more private restroom in the house. it happened to be right around lunch time for my pudgy little cat, who i feed at my desk upstairs, so she was excited and raced upstairs as well. she was a little confused when i headed into the bathroom, but came dancing in behind me and sat in my pants while i took my time on the toilet. i finished up and as one does, i wanted to take a look at the horrid stuff that was causing me so much pain earlier, so i wiped and pulled it up for a gander. in my haste i lost my grip on the paper and like buttered toast it landed soggy side down right on the cat's back. she looked back at it, sniffed, looked up at my with eyes full of dispair, and she took off. i rushed to finish wiping, pullled up my pants and went after her. she had ripped downstairs, losing the paper in the process, then continued into the living room where she dashed into her cubby house. my mom saw her running scared and went over to check on her which involved reaching in the cubby house to pull her out. i get to the living room just in time to hear her say 'what the hell' and pull her hand up to take a whiff. mom turns around, looks me straight in the eye and says 'the cats' pooped on her own back!' in shock. it took all my might to feign confusion as i went to investigate the problem. we then cleaned the cat up with baby wipes while discussing if she needed to go the vet for suffering some sort of mental retardation.

Input: Text: i travel quite a bit for work. i spend on average 60+ nights a year in hotels, not to mention a lot of time on day trips in my car. this morning i was running late for a meeting and rushed out of my hotel without doing my daily constitutional. i was in my car finishing my 2nd cup of coffee when it hit me. i had to go. no time to turn back. i quickly go to my gps to find the nearest hotel and take the exit. 

on a side note, if you travel a lot you will find the best places to do restroom stops are hotels. always clean and private. 

i rush through the lobby like i belong there and head straight for the restroom. it's early morning so the place is pretty crowded with the breakfast crowd. i jump into the first stall i find and let out a  sigh of relief.  about halfway through i hear the door open and the clacking of shoes. the person walks into the next stall and proceeds to sit down and pee. i find this odd because men stand to pee. i glance down and notice women's shoes. i didn't notice the lack of urinals or the over abundance of stalls.  i'm in the women's restroom!

my relief turns to straight panic. here i am with my pants around my ankles and nowhere to go. i quickly lift my legs so no one can see my shoes and make out i'm a guy. i wait for her to finish, which in hindsight is quite amusing. never heard a woman blow ass like that before.  

i clean up best i can in a hurry and slowly peak over the stall to make sure i'm alone. i break for the door and run straight to the men's room to finish up and wash my hands.  i casually walk out of the men's room and run for my car. i made it.

Input: Text: on a throwaway cuz marijuana is still illegal and thats fucking dumb, anyway its my first tifu...this actually happened just now, and im still kinda fucked up. 

so reddit i have this one friend lets call her sarah. i met sarah on tinder. sarah and i started talking and what not and long story short i meet up with her on a few different occasions. these occasions usually start with alcohol and some weed. so fast forward to today and she comes over to "hang out". i show her my place (i just moved) and give her a little tour ending with the master bedroom. i then proceed to pour myself and sarah a full glass of wine (i am ~190 and she is idk a girl). we then go hang out on my couch and play ps4 for a bit while we drink our first cup. after we are done with our first full as fuck cup (she came over completely sober vs me at a 6.5) we then proceed to have another half cup of wine.

after drinking all this wine i am slightly buzzed and she is saying she is kinda drunk. i then come up with the sly move to do some dabs or better known as smoking hash oil (girls love getting high and having sex). for those people reading this that do not know what a dab (or hash oil) is think of it like this, a normal "dab" is the equivalent of smoking an entire bowl of marijuana by yourself. previously, when we were talking she told me she has never done a dab before so i want to give her a good one. 

well reddit this is where i fucked up. i am lazy and use a paperclip as my dabber (the thing you grab the dabs with), the dabs were sticky and i just couldnt get a tiny fucking dab on the paperclip so what do i do? i grab it with my man hands and try to rip off as little a dab as possible (think of like a play-dough ball but way the fuck stickier) and i pull off what i think is decent but a small dab (appropriate for a female), like it would get me decently baked. so i load that shit up for her and she hits it, and right as the "dabber" hits the nail (the thing you heat up) i see it, in all its fucking glory the great billows of smoke pouring out from my oil rig, the billows of smoke saying "you killed her".

i could see it immediately, she started coughing like she was fucking paid to do that shit. she then went in the bathroom to apparently try to calm herself the fuck down because she was dying in there. i go to knock on the door and ask if everything is alright and she said that it was worse when i talked. 

so long story short i try to do everything to calm her down and she just leaves (i did not get laid) and as i type this she is waiting for her uber, i hope she doesnt reddit but its fucking worth it for the story.
Response list: ['i tried to do a dab for my girl and she was fucking dead.']
Ground truth: killed my "date" with a huge dab after she had a few glasses worth of wine

Instruction: In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text. Your task is to generate a short summary for this text. The summary must include a situation which caused humor. The summary should be one or two sentences long.
Input: Text: i'm shaking as i type this. i'm still scared, even though i'm at home, where it's perfectly safe.

this was foreshadowed by a college visit. when trying to turn around in a stressful situation where another car was fast-approaching, she screamed at the back seat passengers to "shut the fuck up."

we were driving through a crowded city, trying to find parking so we could walk through and window shop. we turn in to a lot, and that's where the screaming begins. earlier in the day, she had threatened to punch me for doing silly things, like a too-high voice, etc. perfectly reasonable.

when we got into the lot, we couldn't find a spot, and got kind of chatty. she once again told everyone to "shut the fuck up!" she screamed it this time, at the top of her lungs. my heart felt heavy, but she was my ride, so i couldn't criticize. 

if i have 100 parallel lives, i'm pretty sure i got out of the car and called my busy parents in at least half of them.

when we were trying to get out of the lot, she screamed that if "laugh[ed] one more time [she'd] fucking punch [me]!" i'm a nervous laugher, and i'm pretty sure she knows that. she flipped off a lady who had her kid in the passenger seat. she drove over the curb instead of waiting, and kept screaming at us. my stomach tied into a knot. i think this was the point in my life where i felt the most unsafe.

my friends acted like it was a reasonable response - is it? i feel like this is going to impede my learning-how-to-drive stage. i'm going to throw up.

i've been chased by drunks, but this still took the cake.

Input: Text: i'm a computer gamer. i've had the same very powerful pc for 2 years. i recently purchased a very nice looking case for my computer. set everything up, and turned it on. the computer worked fine but one thing was missing. the front lights, which should have been glowing red. i compulsively opened back up my computer, and searched for a loose cable. eventually i found it. the cable was labeled "pwr led" but was shaped really strange. so i plugged it in anyway into my computer because i just could not live without cool lights. i pressed power, wanting to bask in the glow of my new case. sparks flew out of my pc. turns out the cable had a special port adapter i was not aware of. now nothing happens. won't even show the slightest signs of life. right now i'm typing this from my smart phone. thank god for smart phones. this is my first tifu. it sucks.

Input: Text: this happened on friday. i work and have been at this shoe store for about 3 weeks, which i honestly don't want to disclose the name of it for safety and personal reasons.

i'm typically that guy who's quiet, although i have been working on improving that for about 2 years, so now i'm more quieter than anyone else if anything. people think i'm shy (which is severely annoying because i don't feel like im shy) but in actuality i just don't have anything to say most of the time. i can still conversate with people and whatnot, but for the most part, im just not very outspoken.

half of the entire staff vapes so in the back where we chill, vape, or work on organizing shoe boxes, there are purses, vape mods, and phones on shelves where people just leave them there. i got my own vape i am pretty content with. the fu happens around 15 minutes before closing time. there was 6-7 of us closing, including me. this girl, lets call her tina, puts her mod in her purse, closed up her purse, and walked off somewhere to talk to her relative about something. i was in the back working on organizing converses during closing time because why not, i got nothing else better to do. that's fu #1. others have came into the back for one reason or another but for the most part, i was in the back the most.

when tina was done talking on the phone, it hits closing time and she goes through her purse and notices her vape was gone. that entire 15 minutes it went missing somehow. we all thought her vape was misplaced so we had to almost turn the entire store upside down and even so we still couldn't find it. so it was ruled it was stolen or, at the very least, badly misplaced. i asked someone else if we even had cameras to find out who did it. that's fu #2. she's freaking out around that time that her $100+ mod was stolen. the co-manager was here but it got to the point where the actual manager had to come back from home to sort this thing out. the managers and tina were getting really pissed. eventually we all go home and managers say we'll figure something out tomorrow.

next day, i come back into the store because i had to exchange the shoes i bought yesterday for a bigger size. so while i'm doing that, i asked both the managers if they have found it yet. that's fu #3. they said yes, but they don't wanna talk about it because that was a doozzy, yada yada.

next day, sunday, every single person who works at the shoe store is required to come to a mandatory meeting about sales, black friday, and the such. it was best for everyone to come to the store early. so i came in early and saw tina. already knowing the answer but just wanting to make conversation with her, i was telling her so i heard that it has been found and that's good to hear. still the fu #3. she quickly says "yes, and i know who did it" without looking me in the eye. i thought "okaaay...". everyone who is seasonal and were hired like 3-5 weeks ago were evaluated in the back while the meeting was happening at the sales floor. it was my turn. the manager and some veteran staff including tina, staff who's been at the shoe store for a very long time, were present. i was told im doing a fantastic job sorting converses, but need to be more vocal on the floor, and the such.

but then after all that, they pretty much dropped the bomb and tell me i am the prime suspect who went through her purse, took her vape, and stuck it in a box of timberlands that was put up on the timberlands shelf. the guy who i asked if we had cameras told them i asked them that. another guy claims i was around the timberlands, although i was near converses the entire time working on rearranging the shoes. tina think it's suspicious that i keep asking if it has been found and that i am the only one who's been asking that. not even her best friend asked her anything about the vape. i keep telling them and looking them dead in the eye that i never went through her purse and took her damn vape. only the manager said that if i can look him dead in the eye and swear i didn't do it then he believes me. but if new evidence shows up, i am terminated. i'm still in shock that all of that happens. now almost everyone is convinced that i am the one who did it without solid concrete evidence.

 
edit: formatting and adding additional details.
Response list: ['i was in the back of the store, i got my vape stolen.']
Ground truth: i got accused of going through someones purse, taking their vape, and sticking it in a box of shoes, and asking if we had cameras and asking if it has been found yet has made me the prime suspect.

Input: Text: this happened a few years ago.

my ex wife and i went out drinking and i got blackout drunk. i made the piss poor decision to attempt to drive home. i barely remember fishtailing my car when my ex screamed at me to get out and let her drive. 

we were driving home and i remember driving home with her screaming at me when my genius drunk self told her "well just let me out of the car!" apparently she did. next thing i remember i woke up on the side of the road face down in a ditch. 

i attempted to stumble home and barely remember falling down the hill on the side of the road several times. i finally made it home (which i later measured was over 2 miles). 

when i got home i realized i had no keys and no garage door opener. so i started banging on the door for my ex wife to open the door. i don't remember how long i was banging on the door, and i don't even remember my ex wife opening the door, but i remember falling off the front step of my house into a bush. 

the next morning i woke up, hung over as fuck, and couldn't figure out why my feet hurt so badly. as i lay there, feet throbbing, i felt like my back was itchy. so i rolled over and instantly regretted thst decision. it felt like i was being stung by hundreds of bees at the same time. 

after talking to my ex wife i realized she had kicked me out of the car almost 4 miles from home because i "told her to". while walking home i lost one of my flip flops and fell down the hill on the side of the road several times. after finally making it back home i was banging on the door and fell backwards into a barberry bush. which of you don't know what that is, is a bush with red leaves and thorns. the next morning my ex spent 2 hours with tweezers pulling thorns out of my back.
Response list: ['i got drunk, tried to drive home, fell down the hill on the side of the road several times, and fell into a bush with thorns.']
Ground truth: got hammered, walked 4 miles home with one shoe and fell into a thorn bush.

Input: Text: this actually happened last summer, but being somewhat new to this subreddit i decided to share my wonderful fu with you all. a little bit o' info about me and my so; me and my girlfriend both lived in separate houses. she was 17 and i was 18. we couldn't have sex at her house because her parents watched us like a hawk, not to mention she always had little siblings running into her room. we also couldn't have sex in my room because i shared the basement with my dad, only being separated by a thin wall. both of us newly discovered the life of sex and the great things it hold, so you can only imagine how horny we were 24/7.

 it was approximately 11 p.m. on a saturday night and both of our *"need to have sex"* levels were running high. so without hesitating we jumped in the car and drove a couple of blocks to the nearest park. the parking lot, i so wisely chose, was about 500 feet from any houses and overlooked the city where you could see many bright lights, kinda romantic actually. it belonged to some musical theater or something, i honestly didn't care at the time i just wanted to do the horizontal mombo, if ya catch my drift. anyways, what i didn't notice was that there was construction equipment that wasn't being used in said parking lot. after we pull in and park, we turn the car off and start going at it. we were taking each others clothes off and trying to get into some sort of position in my tiny 2001 toyota corolla (let me tell you, that is a *fucking* mission. literally.) i was facing the back of the car looking towards the entrance of the parking lot, and at this point i was so hyped up and both of our adrenaline was running. then it came... not me err, but a car did. very suddenly and quickly, a car pulled up behind us and just stopped. lights flashing behind us and the sounds of doors opening we both start panicking. at this point i don't remember what was said, i just remember a lot of "shit, shit, shit" and "holy fucking shit that is a cop." and "where the fuck are my pants??" of course they sit there for a little bit, probably waiting for us to get our clothes on or whatever, and i can't find my fucking pants. like had no idea where they were. so the cops, (yes there were two) gets to the window, and we are both sitting in the front. i still couldn't find my pants so i have nothing but a shirt over my crotch and my heart is racing rapidly at this point. like it seriously was the worst de-boner ever. total cockblock. ugh. anyway, the cop on my side, who was female, says to me "sooooooo what are you two up to tonight?" then the cops asked for our i.d.s and before she walked away she said, "why don't you put some pants on it's a little chilly out here." we were both really freaking out at this point, imagining explaining this to our parents. especially her parents because technically she shouldn't even be dating, nor did they know i was dating her. the cops come back, tell us that both our records are clean, and they tell us that some lady across the street saw us pull in. and she called the cops because she thought we were going to mess with some goddamn construction equipment. **like seriously**?? construction equipment was the last thing on my damn mind. i had half a mind to find out where she lived, waited till i heard her having sex, then bust in her room and totally kill the mood. well anyway, luckily we were only given a warning and they didn't contact either of our parents. they just told us not to come back there ever again and said that we were trespassing. like, they really didn't have to tell us not to come back. *don't worry officer, we'll do it at home next time* i had the worst blue balls after that, and needless to say we won't be having sex in a car anytime soon... or ever.
Response list: ["i had sex with my girlfriend in a car, and i was so horny that i didn't even know where the cops were."]
Ground truth: me and my so tried to have sex in a car in a parking lot and the cops were called and they made me have awful blue balls but we got away scot-free.

Input: Text: so i saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6qlz1t/tifu_by_inadvertently_pepper_spraying_my_family/?st=j5sd50x6&sh=051608f2) and it reminded me of this story. i did this maybe seven years ago and i still haven't pulled a better prank, even if this was an accident.  

so my sister bought a tiny pepper spray bottle that you can put on your keychain for easy access. as a younger and curious kid, the concept of pepper spray interested me and i wondered what these things could really do. so while we were sitting in church i was playing with my sister's set of keys during the sermon. i fiddled around with the pepper spray bottle and eventually, sprayed an area a little under the chair in front of me for a tiny second. nothing happened, and i think i was expecting nothing to happen. my younger mind must have thought it was like opening a switchblade and thought nobody would get hurt if i didn't actually use it directly on them. i was horribly wrong. after maybe thirty seconds some people sitting near the center of the church started coughing a little, then a lot. i was coughing a little too, but they were wheezing. my sister starts to notice this and looks at what's in my hand, the pepper spray bottle. she yanks me by the shirt collar and angrily yet quietly said: "did you use the pepper spray?" i nodded my head in fear. she gives me a purple nurple and i almost screamed out during the sermon. "look up you idiot" she said. i looked towards the ceiling and saw that we were sitting right under a big air conditioner. which was aiming right at the coughing people. she forced me to apologize to all of them, one of my teachers who was caught by the pepper spray was quick to forgive saying "that was the greatest prank i have ever seen!"
Response list: ["i pepper sprayed my sister's keys and she was coughing."]
Ground truth: i sprayed pepper spray underneath an air conditioner and caused half a church to start coughing.

Input: Text: to kick things off, let me say that this fuck up did not occur today, but when i was 15 (i'm 19 now).  

i got my first job when i was 14 as a bagger at a local grocery store chain.  i still work there (though no longer a bagger, i've moved up to a supervisor position) when i come back home for breaks from college.  because of my age, i wasn't old enough to drive to work at the time so i would get rides from either my parents or my older sister most of the time.  however, this time was different.  

it was a nice summer day.  i got a ride to work from my dad, but he had to be at a meeting that evening so he couldn't pick me up.  both my mom and older sister were out of town.  so i had to plan on walking four miles home that evening, kind of shitty but not a big deal.  there's a chipotle right across the street from my job, i was hungry.  got off work, bought a chicken burrito and decided to eat it on the walk home.  

as i'm walking home eating this burrito, i started to not feel so hot.  my stomach and i both knew that some shit wasn't right.  as i was nearing the end of this burrito, there was just a barrage of flatulence making its way into the world.  the surrounding ten feet could've been declared a biohazard.  you know in those creepy old elementary school bus safety videos where they talk about the "danger zone"?  think of it like that.  i was not feeling good.  at this point in my walk home though, for the next two miles or so there was nowhere to stop in case i had to answer the call of nature and take a dump.  i could feel it brewing, but i thought i'd be able to make it home in time.  i kept walking.

but the pressure.  oh man.  the pressure in my stomach had begun to assume its authority over me.  i was a little less than two miles away from home at the point when i realized "oh fuck, i don't know how much longer i can keep this in."  i kept it in though for much longer than i thought i'd be able to.  you know that feeling when you're like "oh my god, seriously i'm gonna shit myself right now if i don't get to a toilet in the next 8 seconds"?  i kept it in with that feeling for about another 20 minutes.  i was actually surprised at how long i was able to last in that degree of discomfort.

i was about a mile away from home (keep in mind i've been walking this entire time - running was not an option with my physical state.  i even had to stop walking a few times to take a break when the discomfort got too real).  then it happened.  it was a total 100% involuntary release.  my body could take no more.  a deep mud came ripping out of my ass.  as this assault to my work pants and boxers was committing i let out the most surrendering "ohhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuuuuuck" i've ever let out.  you know that scene in platoon when sgt. elias dies?  it was like that (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkpqb3bepbi skip to 2:33 for the part i'm alluding to).  i had to keep my hand on my ass and my gooch to literally hold the shit in place to prevent it from running down my legs.  i still had about a mile to go.

as i'm walking home in this state of deep embarrassment yet laughter because of how ridiculous this had become, a car driving in my neighborhood stops and the female driver rolls down her window and asks if i'm alright and if i need a ride.  i was walking quite awkwardly with my hand pressed against my ass in a very dedicated manner, so i guess i admire her sense of concern?  i politely decline, and say that i'm almost home and that i just slipped and fell and i'll be fine.  i would've loved to accept that ride, but did i really want to knock her out with the rancid smell of the remnants of that chipotle burrito?  did i really want to ruin her leather interior with a long-lost jackson pollock brown masterpiece?  no, not really.  

i made it home, threw away my pants and boxers, ran up to the bathroom to finish the job.  i called my mom while i was still sitting on the toilet, just laughing my ass off at the recent events and said "mom, you're not gonna believe what just happened to me."
Response list: ['i got a chicken burrito and shit myself.']
Ground truth: i was 15 years old, had to walk four miles home from work, thought it would be a good idea to eat a chipotle burrito on the go and wound up shitting myself, having to walk almost an entire mile with nothing but shit in my pants.

Input: Text: this probably won't be what you were expecting, considering this didn't actually happen today, it happened in elementary school, and does not involve sex, but it's cringe worthy nonetheless (in my opinion). 

one morning i woke up and got dressed, everything was normal. i had my favourite pair of flare jeans on (they were all the rage), but unfortunately it was winter so i had to tuck them into my boots. i didn't notice anything wrong. i didn't notice the extra pair of undies stuck in my pant leg. i guess they had gotten stuck in there during the wash, and somehow i couldn't feel it. so anyway, i went to school and changed into my indoor shoes. my indoor shoes didn't require me to tuck in the flare so that opened the shoot for my underpants to fall out, only they didn't fall out right away, and i still didn't notice them. i guess it took me walking around a bit for them to slowly slide down my leg. yet still i didn't feel it.

 i sat at the front of the class and when the teacher started teaching, i guess thats when they finally fell out. i was still oblivious. who knows how long they were there for, just sitting under my desk. so anyway, my teacher finishes the lesson and gives us time to work on stuff or fill out a sheet or something, i don't remember what. suddenly the teacher comes over to me. now this teacher was the coolest teacher in the school according to everybody, and me being a teachers pet, i thought for sure something good was gonna happen. maybe i would get to be the chalkboard cleaner for the day? or take the attendance down to the office? oh how i wish it was one of those things, but no. she came over to my desk and in a low voice said "i think you dropped something under your desk" then quickly walked away. thank god she didn't draw any attention to me. i looked under my desk and sure enough there were my orange and red flowered underwear. i briefly wondered how they got there, quickly grabbed them, balled them in my hand so nobody could tell what i was holding and ran out of the class. i went to my locker and quickly shoved them in my backpack and came back to class, sure my red face would give me away. nobody said anything though. either i was oblivious to people noticing or i truly got away with it. to this day i'm still not sure. 

i still get very awkward when i see the teacher around. she's the only one that knows and she probably remembers the incident better than i do because i was young. sometimes my friends and i will visit our old elementary school and drop in to some of our favourite teachers classes. since she was a favourite they always want to visit her, but at all costs i always try to avoid it.

Input: Passage: By 1875 Ricketts had named the tallest waterfall on Kitchen Creek Ganoga Falls, and in 1881, he renamed Long Pond as Ganoga Lake. Pennsylvania senator Charles R. Buckalew suggested the name Ganoga, an Iroquoian word which he said meant "water on the mountain" in the Seneca language. Donehoo's A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in  Pennsylvania identifies it as a Cayuga language word meaning "place of floating oil" and the name of a Cayuga village in New York. Whatever the meaning, Ganoga Lake is the source of the branch of Kitchen Creek that flows through Ganoga Glen, which has the tallest waterfall.A dam was built upstream of the waterfalls on the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek in 1842. Ricketts strengthened the dam circa 1905 as part of a hydroelectric power generation scheme, and renamed the body of water Lake Rose (Rose is a Ricketts family name). However, both the Lake Rose and Lake Leigh dams were "poorly constructed" and could not be used to generate power; both dams were condemned by the state and Lake Rose was drained in 1969. Ganoga Glen is not as steep as Glen Leigh; both glens are almost entirely in the Huntley Mountain Formation, with a small region at the southern end, including Waters Meet, in the Catskill Formation.
 
Ganoga Glen has ten named waterfalls in 1.1 miles (1.8 km). It is 1.8 miles (2.9 km) from PA 118 in the south to Waters Meet and the southern end of Ganoga Glen. From the north, it is 0.3 miles (0.48 km) from the Lake Rose trailhead parking lot by Lake Jean to Mohawk, the northernmost waterfall. There is also the 2.8-mile (4.5 km) Ganoga View Trail, which leads from Pennsylvania Route 487 in the west to Ganoga Falls. The Highland Trail, which meets the Falls Trail a short distance north of Mohawk Falls, is the 1.2-mile (1.9 km) connector between the northern ends of Ganoga Glen and Glen Leigh.Jeff Mitchell writes in Hiking the Endless Mountains: Exploring the Wilderness of Northeast Pennsylvania that Ganoga Glen has his "favorite place" in the park: "Here the trail wraps around ledges and underneath overhanging rocks, right next to the waterfalls. The roar of the falls reverberates against their rocky confines. The state park trail map says that Seneca, Delaware, and Mohican Falls are here, but it is hard to discern which falls are which because they explode from everywhere and are continuous.". 
Question: What is the name of the person that Charles R. Buckalew suggested the names to?
Response list: ['Ricketts.']
Ground truth: Ricketts.

Input: Passage: When high school music teacher Michael McCann discovers his wife is pregnant by his best friend, he divorces her and retreats into a life of solitude as a maker of finely crafted furniture in rural Virginia. Five years later, his only companion is a valuable collection of gold coins. Tanny Newland, the unsavory younger brother of politician John Newland, crashes his brother's car in the woods surrounding Michael's house, seriously injuring the woman he is with. Afraid of being arrested for drunk driving, Tanny steals Michael's coins while he is sleeping, takes off into the night and is never seen again.
Weeks later during a winter storm, Michael is startled to discover a toddler has wandered into his home while he was outside gathering wood. A short distance away he discovers the body of her mother, a heroin addict whose car had run out of gas nearby. Unbeknownst to him, the child is the illegitimate daughter of John Newland, who participates in the investigation but keeps his relationship to the child a secret in order to protect his career.
Michael is permitted to adopt the child and christens her Mathilda. She proves to be a bit of a handful in her early years, but with the help of friend and local shopkeeper April Simon, Michael manages to raise her to be a bright, personable, precocious young lady, and the once sour, lonely man is transformed by her presence. As John Newland watches his daughter grow older, he begins to invite her to join him and wife Nancy in their home. John arranges for her to learn to ride a horse, eventually giving her one of her own.
Due to Nancy's two miscarriages and the couple's deep desire to have a child, Nancy insists on adoption. John finally reveals Mathilda's true identity and his desire to adopt her properly. Nancy encourages him to gain custody of the girl, and a trial ensues. 
Question: What is the full name of the person whose car is crashed in the woods by their sibling?
Response list: ['John Newland.']

Input: Passage: Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd "a spent force creatively." When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. He later told The Sunday Times: "Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him." In 2013, Waters said he had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members, and was wrong to have attempted to stop the others using it. 
Question: What is the last name of the person whose affairs were managed by Peter Rudge?
Response list: ['Waters.']
Ground truth: Waters.

Input: Passage: In the year 2000, Dick Harper has been promoted to Vice President of Communications for a large media corporation known as Globodyne. The following day, he is on a television program with presidential candidate Ralph Nader, who calls Globodyne "perverters of the American dream", claiming it helps the super-rich get even wealthier. As they speak, Globodyne's stock value collapses, rendering all investments – including all the employees' savings and pensions – worthless. Dick arrives home, where his wife Jane tells him that she quit her job as a travel agent following his promotion to spend more time with the family. Dick breaks the news of the company's failure over dinner. Despite his attempts, Dick is unable to find another job with comparable pay, and within a short time, the family faces bankruptcy.
After accepting the prospect of being poor, Dick and Jane apply for low-paying jobs. Both are unable to keep them, and soon their utilities are cut off, forcing them to sell off personal property to stay afloat. When they are confronted with a 24-hour eviction notice, Dick decides to turn to a life of crime. After several failed robbery attempts, Dick and Jane successfully rob a head shop. They begin nightly robbing sprees and become more comfortable and professional over time. They soon steal enough money to pay off their debts including their house and car, both of which were about to be repossessed. For one last heist, Dick and Jane plan to rob a local bank. All goes as planned until the Petersons – another couple formerly employed at Globodyne – make an amateurish attempt to rob the same bank. The Petersons are quickly arrested, and the Harpers take advantage of the hysteria to evade police and escape. 
Question: What was Dick's company called that caused a stock dive?
Response list: ['Globodyne.']

Input: Passage: Ben and Arthur are a gay couple eagerly awaiting the legalization of gay marriage in Hawaii so that they may travel there for their dream wedding. After a news bulletin that a judge has made a ruling that will allow gay marriages to take place, the men purchase plane tickets and prepare to depart; however, before they leave, they discover that a challenge to the judge's ruling has resulted in a suspension of gay marriage in Hawaii, pending further judicial review. Ben takes advantage of the delay to inform Arthur that he is actually already married to a woman named Tammy, whom he wed out of societal pressure before he came to terms with his homosexuality and from whom he has been separated since before he and Arthur met. Arthur becomes angry, but decides to stay with Ben anyway. Shortly thereafter, Ben contacts Tammy, finally comes out to her, and asks her for a divorce.
After the disappointment of their near-wedding, Ben and Arthur resume their daily life, working in a small diner in Los Angeles, where Ben is a dishwasher and Arthur is a waiter. Although Ben—a former nurse who quit to pursue a music career—enjoys the manual labor and hours, Arthur has grown impatient with servitude and putting up with needy customers. One night, Arthur decides to quit and go back to college, so that he can earn an MBA and open up his own sex shop. Although the loss of income to the household means that Ben will have to quit and return to being a nurse, he agrees to do so in order to help Arthur pursue his dream.

Input: Passage: In 1933, Freya Roth is a young German girl engaged to a Nazi party member. When she realizes the true nature of his political views she breaks the engagement and turns her attention to anti-Nazi Martin Breitner. Her father, Professor Roth, does not abide by the attitude of the new order towards scientific fact.
Though his stepsons Erich and Otto eagerly embrace the regime, Professor Roth's reluctance to conform leads at first to a boycott of his classes and eventually to his arrest and a sentence of forced physical labor. His wife is permitted a five-minute visit in which the professor urges her to take Freya and her younger brother and leave the country. He dies soon after.
Freya is kept from leaving by Nazi officials suspicious of her father's work. She reunites with Martin and together they attempt to escape through a mountain pass. A squad reluctantly led by her former fiancee gives chase and Freya is fatally wounded, dying in Martin's arms just after they cross the border. Later, Erich and Otto are informed of their sister's death. Erich responds with anger towards Martin.  Otto, however, experiences an epiphany, and flees their once-happy home, rejecting the Nazis and their cruel doctrine.

Input: Passage: By the time Smetana completed his schooling, his father's fortunes had declined. Although František now agreed that his son should follow a musical career, he could not provide financial support. In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty gulden, and no immediate prospects. Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kateřina Kolářová's mother to Josef Proksch, head of the Prague Music Institute—where Kateřina was now studying. Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on Beethoven, Chopin, Berlioz and the Leipzig circle of Liszt. In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, and at the same time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.For the next three years, besides teaching piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, bagatelles, impromptus and the G minor Piano Sonata. In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French composer at a reception arranged by Proksch. At the home of Count Thun he met Robert and Clara Schumann, and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work—they detected too much of Berlioz in it. Meanwhile, his friendship with Kateřina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement. He then set out on a tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a concert pianist. 
Question: What is the name of the person who showed Robert and Clara Schumann their G minor sonata?
Response list: ['Smetana.']
Ground truth: Smetana.

Input: Passage: Wildlife photographer Pickett Smith is taking photographs of the local flora and fauna as he canoes through a swamp surrounding an island containing the affluent mansion estate of the wealthy and influential Crockett family. Also evident throughout the swamp are numerous indicators of pollution, which Pickett believes are connected to pesticide use on the island plantation. After Clint Crockett accidentally tips over Smith's canoe, he and his sister Karen escort Smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire Crockett family. The grouchy, wheelchair-bound patriarch Jason intends on spending the next day enjoying both the 4th of July and his own birthday celebrations uninterrupted. Due to the mutual dislike of the fauna around the mansion, Jason sends a man named Grover to spray pesticide in order to get rid of the frogs. Pickett later discovers Grover's corpse covered in snakebites in the swamp not far from the house. Despite this warning, Jason continues with his celebrations the next day.
Early next morning, Michael Martindale sets out to check on a possible downed telephone line. He accidentally shoots himself in the leg and is rendered immobile by strange white moss hanging down from the surrounding trees. Tarantulas descend from the branches and kill him. 
Back on the estate, Jason's sister, Iris Martindale sends her son, Kenneth into the greenhouse to collect flowers for a centerpiece. As he gathers the flowers, he fails to notice dozens of tokay geckos entering behind him. The geckos swarm over the stacked shelves, knocking over numerous jars of poisonous chemicals, and the resulting toxic gas asphyxiates him.
Seeing the danger posed by the animals, Pickett suggests that everyone should leave the island, but Jason is adamant that nothing will ruin his birthday. 
Question: How did Iris's son die?
Response list: ['toxic gas.']
Ground truth: toxic gas asphyxiates him.

Input: Passage: Eakins referred to the painting as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, "apparently lost in a contemplative moment". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast.
The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.In Eakins' oeuvre, The Swimming Hole was immediately preceded by a number of similar works on the Arcadian theme. These correspond to lectures he gave on Ancient Greek sculpture and were inspired by the Pennsylvania Academy's casts of Phidias' Pan-Athenaic procession from the Parthenon marbles. A series of photographs, relief sculptures, and oil sketches culminated in the 1883 Arcadia, a painting that also featured nude figures—posed for by a student, a nephew, and the artist's fiancée—in a pastoral landscape. 
Question: What are the four titles the painting has been referred as?
Response list: ['Swimming.']
Ground truth: Swimming.

Input: Passage: In 1948, Frank Wheeler meets April at a party. He is a longshoreman, hoping to be a cashier; she wants to be an actress. Frank later secures a sales position with Knox Machines, for which his father worked for 20 years, and he and April marry. The Wheelers move to 115 Revolutionary Road in suburban Connecticut when April becomes pregnant.
The couple becomes close friends with their realtor Helen Givings and her husband Howard Givings, and neighbor Milly Campbell and her husband Shep. To their friends, the Wheelers are the perfect couple, but their relationship is troubled. April fails to make a career out of acting, while Frank hates the tedium of his work. On his 30th birthday, Frank invites a secretary at work to have a drink with him at a bar.  She accepts, gets tipsy, and they end up having sex in a hotel. Meanwhile, Helen has asked April if they will meet her son, John, who had been in an insane asylum.  She thinks the younger couple may be able to help her son with his condition. April accepts.
April wants new scenery and a chance to support the family so Frank can find his passion, so she suggests that they move to Paris to start a new life away from the "hopeless emptiness" of their repetitive lifestyle. Frank balks at the idea at first, but becomes convinced. Over the next several weeks, the Wheelers tell their various friends about their plans to live in Paris, but surprisingly, the only person who seems to comprehend their decision is John.
As the couple prepares to move, they are forced to reconsider. Frank is offered a promotion, and April becomes pregnant again. When Frank discovers she is contemplating having an abortion, he is furious and starts screaming at April, leading to a serious altercation, in which April says that they had their second child only to prove the first child was not a "mistake".

Input: Passage: Temperley writes: "After 1855 [Bennett] was spurred by belated honours, and occasional commissions, to compose a respectable number of significant and substantial works, though it was too late to recapture his early self-confidence." Works from his later years included the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti; a pastoral cantata, The May Queen, Op. 39, for the opening of the Leeds Town Hall in 1858; an Ode (Op. 40) with words by Alfred, Lord Tennyson for the opening of the 1862 International Exhibition in London; an Installation Ode for Cambridge University (Op. 41) with words by Charles Kingsley, which included a lament for the late Prince Albert; a symphony in G minor (Op. 43); a sacred cantata,The Woman of Samaria for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1867; and finally a second Piano Sonata (The Maid of Orleans, Op. 46). Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa, who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct anything by Bennett. Eventually it was conducted by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber also commissioned for the occasion. The affair leaked into the press, and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour.In March 1856 Bennett, while still teaching at the RAM and Queen's College, was elected Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge. He modernised the system of awarding music degrees, instituting viva voce examinations and requiring candidates for doctorates to first take the degree of Bachelor of Music. Two years later on 8 June 1868 the newly formed (later Royal) College of Organists awarded him an Honorary Fellowship.In 1858 came yet another clash involving Costa, when the autocratic Earl of Westmorland, the original founder of the RAM, saw fit to arrange a subscription concert for the Academy to include a Mass of his own composition, to be conducted by Costa and using the orchestra and singers of the Opera, over the heads of the Academy directors. Bennett resigned from the RAM at this overbearing behaviour, and was not to return until 1866. Towards the end of 1862 Bennett's wife died after a painful illness. His biographer W. B. Squire suggests that "he never recovered from the effects of Mrs. Bennett's death, and that henceforward a painful change in him became apparent to his friends." In 1865 Bennett again visited Leipzig where he was reunited with old friends including Ferdinand David, and his Op. 43 Symphony was performed.

Input: Passage: During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky.
On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading "NKVD" on the memorial, covering the word "Nazis" in the inscription such that it read "In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941." Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented:
It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.
Brzezinski further stated:
The fact that the Soviet government has enabled me to be here—and the Soviets know my views—is symbolic of the breach with Stalinism that perestroika represents.
His remarks were given extensive coverage on Soviet television. At the ceremony he placed a bouquet of red roses bearing a handwritten message penned in both Polish and English: "For the victims of Stalin and the NKVD. Zbigniew Brzezinski".On 13 April 1990, the forty-seventh anniversary of the discovery of the mass graves, the USSR formally expressed "profound regret" and admitted Soviet secret police responsibility. The day was declared a worldwide Katyn Memorial Day (Polish: Światowy Dzień Pamięci Ofiar Katynia).

Input: Passage: Bartlett decided to send a team back to establish the exact location of the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3 km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and his group (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) announced they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: "We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land." The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp. Thereafter the only hint of their fate was a sailor's scarf belonging to Morris, later found buried in an ice floe. It was assumed that the four had either been crushed by the ice, or had fallen through it.

Input: Passage: Lyon Gaultier is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved.
Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him. Figuring that this would be the best way to earn the money he needs to get to L.A., Lyon fights in a no-holds-barred bare-knuckle fights to finance the trip.
Once in L.A. Lyon goes to the hospital where his brother was taken. He learns that he cannot avenge his brother's murder, as he failed to identify his killers before dying. Grief-stricken, Lyon asks the help of Joshua who tracks down his brother's widow's address. However she refuses to accept any financial aid from him, even though she obviously needs it, because she is angry with Lyon for "deserting" his brother years ago. She threatens to call the cops and Lyon has no choice but to leave. 
Question: What is the first name of the person who steels a jeep?
Response list: ['Lyon.']

Input: Passage: Although no new fighting techniques were introduced during the Texas Revolution, casualty figures were quite unusual for the time.  Generally in 19th-century warfare, the number of wounded outnumbered those killed by a factor of two or three.  From October 1835 through April 1836, approximately 1,000 Mexican and 700 Texian soldiers died, while the wounded numbered 500 Mexican and 100 Texian.  The deviation from the norm was due to Santa Anna's decision to label Texian rebels as traitors and to the Texian desire for revenge.During the revolution, Texian soldiers gained a reputation for courage and militance.   Lack points out that fewer than five percent of the Texian population enrolled in the army during the war, a fairly low rate of participation.  Texian soldiers recognized that the Mexican cavalry was far superior to their own.  Over the next decade, the Texas Rangers borrowed Mexican cavalry tactics and adopted the Spanish saddle and spurs, the riata, and the bandana.The Texas Veterans Association, composed solely of revolutionary veterans living in Texas, was active from 1873 through 1901 and played a key role in convincing the legislature to create a monument to honor the San Jacinto veterans.  In the late 19th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the San Jacinto battlesite, which is now home to the San Jacinto Monument, the tallest stone column monument in the world.  In the early 20th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the Alamo Mission, now an official state shrine. In front of the church, in the center of Alamo Plaza, stands a cenotaph designed by Pompeo Coppini which commemorates the defenders who died during the battle. More than 2.5 million people visit the Alamo every year.The Texas Revolution has been the subject of poetry and of many books, plays and films. Most English-language treatments reflect the perspectives of the Anglos and are centered primarily on the battle of the Alamo.  From the first novel depicting events of the revolution, 1838's Mexico versus Texas, through the mid-20th century, most works contained  themes of anticlericalism and racism, depicting the battle as a fight for freedom between good (Anglo Texian) and evil (Mexican). In both English- and Spanish-language literature, the Alamo is often compared to the battle of Thermopylae.  The 1950s Disney miniseries Davy Crockett, which was largely based on myth, created a worldwide craze for everything Alamo-related. Within several years, John Wayne directed and starred in one of the best-known and perhaps least historically accurate film versions, The Alamo (1960).  Notably, this version made the first attempt to leave behind racial stereotypes; it was still banned in Mexico.  In the late 1970s, works about the Alamo began to explore Tejano perspectives, which had been all but extinguished even from textbooks about the revolution, and to explore the revolution's links to slavery.

Input: Passage: In 1985, Tim Gane formed McCarthy, a band from Essex, England, known for their left-wing politics. Gane met Lætitia Sadier, born in France, at a McCarthy concert in Paris and the two quickly fell in love. The musically-inclined Sadier was disillusioned with the rock scene in France and soon moved to London to be with Gane and pursue her career. In 1990, after three albums, McCarthy broke up and Gane immediately formed Stereolab with Sadier (who had also contributed vocals to McCarthy's final album), ex-Chills bassist Martin Kean and Gina Morris on backing vocals. Stereolab's name was taken from a division of Vanguard Records demonstrating hi-fi effects.
Gane and Sadier, along with future band manager Martin Pike, created a record label called Duophonic Super 45s which, along with later offshoot Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, would become commonly known as "Duophonic". Gane said that their "original plan" was to distribute multiple 7 and 10 inch records "–to just do one a month and keep doing them in small editions". The 10 inch vinyl EP Super 45, released in May 1991, was the first release for both Stereolab and the label, and was sold through mail order and through the Rough Trade Shop in London. Super 45's band-designed album art and packaging was the first of many customised and limited-edition Duophonic records. In a 1996 interview in The Wire, Gane calls the "do-it-yourself" aesthetic behind Duophonic "empowering", and said that by releasing one's own music "you learn; it creates more music, more ideas".Stereolab released the EP, Super-Electric in September 1991, and a single, titled Stunning Debut Album, followed in November 1991 (which was neither debut nor album). The early material was rock and guitar-oriented; of Super-Electric, Jason Ankeny wrote in AllMusic that "Droning guitars, skeletal rhythms, and pop hooks—not vintage synths and pointillist melodies—were their calling cards ..." Under the independent label Too Pure, the group's first full-length album, Peng! was released in May 1992. A compilation titled, Switched On, was released in October 1992 and would be part of a series of compilations that anthologise the band's more obscure material.Around this time, the line-up consisted of Gane and Sadier plus vocalist and guitarist Mary Hansen, drummer Andy Ramsay, bassist Duncan Brown, and keyboardist Katharine Gifford. Hansen, born in Australia, had been in touch with Gane since his McCarthy days. After joining, she and Sadier developed a style of vocal counterpoint that distinguished Stereolab's sound. After a concert in the early 1990s, the band was introduced to Sean O'Hagan, who had recently formed the band the High Llamas. He recalled: "we got on very well. Their keyboard player left and they needed a quick replacement for a tour. I filled in but then was invited in on [their next] record. I was allowed to make suggestions and the fun started.".

Input: Passage: San Francisco (SF; , Spanish: [sam fɾanˈsisko]; Spanish for 'Saint Francis'), officially the City and County of San Francisco, is a city in, and the cultural, commercial, and financial center of, Northern California. San Francisco is the 13th-most populous city in the United States, and the fourth-most populous in California, with 883,305 residents as of 2018. It covers an area of about 46.89 square miles (121.4 km2), mostly at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area, making it the second-most densely populated large US city, and the fifth-most densely populated U.S. county, behind only four of the five New York City boroughs. San Francisco is also part of the fifth-most populous primary statistical area in the United States, the San Jose–San Francisco–Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area (9.67 million residents).
As of 2017, it was the seventh-highest income county in the United States, with a per capita personal income of $119,868. As of 2015, San Francisco proper had a GDP of $154.2 billion, and a GDP per capita of $177,968. The San Francisco CSA was the country's third-largest urban economy as of 2017, with a GDP of $907 billion.  Of the 500+ primary statistical areas in the US, the San Francisco CSA had among the highest GDP per capita in 2017, at $93,938. San Francisco was ranked 14th in the world and third in the United States on the Global Financial Centres Index as of September 2018.San Francisco was founded on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain established Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de Asís a few miles away, all named for St. Francis of Assisi. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856. San Francisco's status as the West Coast's largest city peaked between 1870 and 1900, when around 25% of California's population resided in the city proper.  After three-quarters of the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire, San Francisco was quickly rebuilt, hosting the Panama-Pacific International Exposition nine years later. In World War II, San Francisco was a major port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater. It then became the birthplace of the United Nations in 1945. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, significant immigration, liberalizing attitudes, along with the rise of the "hippie" counterculture, the Sexual Revolution, the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States. Politically, the city votes strongly along liberal Democratic Party lines.

Input: Passage: Little documentary evidence of the games remains; contemporary and near-contemporary writings mostly record the major details and concentrate on the opening days. The poet Martial gives the most complete and only truly contemporary account in the form of his De Spectaculis ("On the Spectacles"), a somewhat sycophantic series of epigrams detailing the individual events of the games as an illustration of Titus' power and benevolence. Much of the work is concerned with praising Titus, and there have been difficulties with authenticating, dating and translating various portions, but Martial does give details of events not covered by other sources and the only known surviving complete record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena.The historian Suetonius was born in about AD 70, and started writing around AD 100. He was a child at the time of the games, but it is possible that he was born and raised in Rome, so he may have witnessed the inaugural games first-hand. His De Vita Caesarum (Lives of the Caesars, known also as The Twelve Caesars or Lives of the Twelve Caesars) probably completed around AD 117 to 127, includes some detail on the opening days of the games. Later in his history of Titus he reveals further information about the games. Suetonius' histories of the early Caesars have been criticised for being based on rumour and gossip rather than accurate historical sources, and he often reports from sources which contradict each other without attempting to analyse their quality or accuracy. However, he is generally regarded as a thorough scholar and has been praised for his balanced treatment of his subjects.The only other major source of information on the games is Cassius Dio who lived in the latter second and early third centuries. His History of Rome spans 80 books written in 22 years, but much of which are only fragments. He is noted for his attention to detail in administrative affairs, but for major events his writing can be merely impressionistic, with a greater emphasis put on his interpretation of the events' significance within the wider historical context rather than reporting details. His sources are varied: he relies on many of the major commentators but also seems to have paid close attention to public records. His account of the Titus games is not sourced. 
Question: What is the full name of the person whose writing can be merely impressionistic for major events?
Response list: ['Cassius Dio.']

Input: Passage: In inner city London,a street dance crew is on the verge of breaking up after its leader, Jay, leaves the group unexpectedly. The group loses the use of their rehearsal space, forcing them to try to raise money or practice in other locations. Eventually they secure a space in a ballet school, on the condition that they include five ballet dancers in their routine. At first, they struggle to get along, but they all become friends in the end.
One of the teachers at the ballet school, Helena, takes Carly to a ballet where she starts getting ideas for their routine. When she arrives home, Carly finds Jay waiting for her and the two spend the night having sex. During a dance battle in a club the next night, the team learn that Jay has betrayed the team by joining The Surge, a rival crew. Jay brags about his sex with Carly and Tomas, a ballet dancer, punches Jay out of anger. Jay is furious and swears revenge. Carly, upset over the betrayal, leaves the club and is nearly hit by a car before Tomas pulls her out of the way. Tomas then takes Carly back to his apartment where they dance on the roof, eventually kissing. Carly then leaves him alone on the roof, while they both look at the sunrise and smile.
The next day at the school, Carly announces the new name of their dance crew: Breaking Point. Another teacher at the school, outraged that her students are being corrupted, deliberately plans a Royal Ballet audition for the same day as the street dance finals. The ballet dancers promise Carly they will make it, but the auditions were running overtime.

Input: Passage: In support of Nine Inch Nails' third full-length studio album, The Fragile, the live-band reformed for the Fragility tour.  The lineup remained largely the same from the Self-Destruct tour, featuring Finck, Clouser, and Lohner.  To replace long-time member Vrenna, Reznor held open auditions to find a new drummer, eventually picking then-unknown Jerome Dillon.  Dillon would remain a member of the live band until 2005.
Nine Inch Nails' record label at the time, Interscope Records, reportedly refused to fund the promotional tour following The Fragile's lukewarm sales.  Reznor instead committed himself to fund the entire tour out of his own pocket, concluding that "The reality is, I’m broke at the end of the tour," but also adding "I will never present a show that isn’t fantastic."The Fragility tour began in late 1999, running until mid-2000, and was broken into two major legs, Fragility 1.0 and Fragility 2.0 respectively.  Destinations included Europe, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and North America.  Before the first Fragility performance date in Spain, Nine Inch Nails opened their final rehearsal in London to 100 fans. Kick-starting the tour was a performance of the title track from The Fragile at the MTV Video Music Awards.  Atari Teenage Riot opened for Nine Inch Nails during Fragility 1.0, and A Perfect Circle for Fragility 2.0.  At the time, A Perfect Circle featured Josh Freese on drums, who would later replace Dillon and play drums for Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007. The tour featured increasingly large production values, including a triptych video display created by contemporary video artist Bill Viola. Rolling Stone magazine named Fragility the best tour of 2000.In 2002, the tour documentary And All That Could Have Been was released featuring a collection of performances from the Fragility 2.0 tour.  While making the DVD, Reznor commented on the tour in retrospect by saying "I thought the show was really, really good when we were doing it", but later admitted that he "can't watch [the DVD] at all. I was sick for most of that tour and I really don't think it was Nine Inch Nails at its best".

Input: Passage: The Wiggles are an Australian children's music group formed in Sydney, New South Wales, in 1991. Since 2013, the group members are Anthony Field, Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce, and Emma Watkins.  The original members were Field, Phillip Wilcher, Murray Cook, Greg Page, and Jeff Fatt. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Page, Cook, and Fatt retired, and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce, and Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects.
Field and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band The Cockroaches in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at Macquarie University, where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of children's music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album, and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time.  The group augmented their act with animal characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog, as well as the character Captain Feathersword, played by Paul Paddick since 1993.  They travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The group's DVDs, CDs, and television programs have been produced independently since their inception.  Their high point came in the early 2000s, after they broke into the American market.
The group was formally consolidated in 2005.  They were listed at the top of Business Review Weekly's top-earning Australian entertainers four years in a row, and earned A$45 million in 2009.  In 2011, the worldwide recession hit The Wiggles, as it had done for many Australian entertainers; they earned $28 million, but they still appeared second on BRW's list that year.  The Wiggles have enjoyed almost universal approval throughout their history, and their music has been played in pre-schools all over the world.  They have earned several Platinum, Double Platinum and Multi-Platinum records, as well as sold 23 million DVDs and 7 million CDs, and have performed, on average, to one million people per year.  The group has also earned multiple Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) and Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Music Awards.

Input: Passage: The Five was among the myriad of subjects Tchaikovsky discussed with his benefactress, Nadezhda von Meck. By January 1878, when he wrote to Mrs. von Meck about its members, he had drifted far from their musical world and ideals. In addition, The Five's finest days had long passed. Despite considerable effort in writing operas and songs, Cui had become better known as a critic than as a composer, and even his critical efforts competed for time with his career as an army engineer and expert in the science of fortification. Balakirev had withdrawn completely from the musical scene, Mussorgsky was sinking ever deeper into alcoholism, and Borodin's creative activities increasingly took a back seat to his official duties as a professor of chemistry.
Only Rimsky-Korsakov actively pursued a full-time musical career, and he was under increasing fire from his fellow nationalists for much the same reason as Tchaikovsky had been. Like Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov had found that, for his own artistic growth to continue unabated, he had to study and master Western classical forms and techniques. Borodin called it "apostasy", adding, "Many are grieved at present by the fact that Korsakov has turned back, has thrown himself into a study of musical antiquity. I do not bemoan it. It is understandable...." Mussorgsky was harsher: "[T]he mighty kuchka had degenerated into soulless traitors."Tchaikovsky's analysis of each of The Five was unsparing. While at least some of his observations may seem distorted and prejudiced, he also mentions some details which ring clear and true. His diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is very accurate. He also calls Mussorgsky the most gifted musically of the Five, though Tchaikovsky could not appreciate the forms Mussorgsky's originality took. Nonetheless, he badly underestimates Borodin's technique and gives Balakirev far less than his full due—all the more telling in light of Balakirev's help in conceiving and shaping Romeo and Juliet.Tchaikovsky wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that all of the kuchka were talented but also "infected to the core" with conceit and "a purely dilettantish confidence in their superiority." He went into some detail about Rimsky-Korsakov's epiphany and turnaround regarding musical training, and his efforts to remedy this situation for himself. Tchaikovsky then called Cui "a talented dilettante" whose music "has no originality, but is clever and graceful"; Borodin a man who "has talent, even a strong one, but it has perished through neglect ... and his technique is so weak that he cannot write a single line [of music] without outside help"; Mussorgsky "a hopeless case", superior in talent but "narrow-minded, devoid of any urge towards self-perfection"; and Balakirev as one with "enormous talent" yet who had also "done much harm" as "the general inventor of all the theories of this strange group".

Input: Passage: In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—"Night After Night", and "I Had a Dream About You, Baby", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's "The Usual". The film was a critical and commercial flop.
Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, "Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual."The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: "The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant." The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Michael Gray wrote that the album was: "Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s." The track "Most of the Time", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while "What Was It You Wanted?" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans. The religious imagery of "Ring Them Bells" struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith. 
Question: What were the full names of the four Traveling Wilburys that recorded a second album?

"Single Ladies" ranked as the second-best song of the 2000s decade in the magazine's 2009 readers' poll, and Rolling Stone critics placed it at number 50 on the list of the 100 Best Songs of the Decade. "Single Ladies" was placed at number two on MTV News' list of The Best Songs of 2008; James Montgomery called it "hyperactive and supercharged in ways I never thought possible. It's epic and sexy and even a bit sad." "There is absolutely zero chance Beyoncé ever releases a single like this ever again", Montgomery concluded. Time magazine's critic Josh Tyrangiel, who called the song "ludicrously infectious", ranked it as the seventh-best song of 2008. Douglas Wolf of the same publication placed it at number nine on his list of the All-Time 100 Songs."Single Ladies" appeared at number six on the Eye Weekly's critics' list of the Best Singles of 2008, and at number six on About.com's Mark Edward Nero's list of the Best R&B Songs of 2008. On The Village Voice's year-end Pazz & Jop singles list, "Single Ladies" was ranked at numbers three and forty one in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Additionally, the Maurice Joshua Club Mix of the song was ranked at number 443 on the 2008 list. "Single Ladies" was named the best song of the 2000s decade by Black Entertainment Television (BET). Sarah Rodman, writing for The Boston Globe, named "Single Ladies" the fourth most irresistible song of the decade, and stated, "[Beyoncé] combined leotards with crass engagement-bling baiting into one delicious sexy-yet-antiquated package. The video had the whole world dancing and waving along via YouTube." VH1 ranked "Single Ladies" at number sixteen on its list of The 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s. In his book Eating the Dinosaur (2009), Chuck Klosterman wrote that "Single Ladies" is "arguably the first song overtly marketed toward urban bachelorette parties". Jody Rosen of The New Yorker credited the melodies that float and dart over the thump for creating a new sound in music that didn't exist in the world before Beyoncé. He further wrote, "If they sound 'normal' now, it's because Beyoncé, and her many followers, have retrained our ears.".

Input: Passage: McVeigh later said that he had contemplated assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.A resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because of the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The Murrah building had been previously targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell. The group had plotted to park "a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer." After Snell's appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied, he was executed the same day as the Murrah bombing.The nine-story building, built in 1977, was named for a federal judge and housed fourteen federal agencies, including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps. The Murrah building was chosen for its glass front – which was expected to shatter under the impact of the blast – and its adjacent large, open parking lot across the street, which might absorb and dissipate some of the force, and protect the occupants of nearby non-federal buildings. In addition, McVeigh believed that the open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes. The attack was planned to take place on April 19, 1995, to coincide with the 2nd anniversary of the Waco siege and the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord.

Input: Passage: The film opens with an English schoolteacher, Gwen Mayfield, packing up her belongings at a mission school in colonial Africa. The local witch doctors have led a rebellion, and they reach the school before she is able to escape—the shaman wearing a body mask. Gwen screams, and the scene dissolves to the opening credits.
The next scene is back home in England, where Gwen meets with the apparently Reverend Alan Bax for a job interview. We discover that Gwen suffered a nervous breakdown from whatever she experienced at the hand of the rebels when the school was attacked. Alan is impressed by Gwen and hires her to be the new head teacher at the small private school he and his sister, well-known journalist Stephanie Bax, run for the local children in the village of Heddaby.
Upon moving into the teacher's cottage, Gwen asks her maid, Valerie Creek, where she might find the rectory. Valerie is confused—she knows there is no rectory—until Gwen explains she would like to thank Mr. Bax. "Oh, you mean the Baxes' house!" she says, and shows her the way after tea.
At the house, Gwen meets Stephanie and mentions she tried to look for the church on the way but couldn't find it. Stephanie explains there isn't any church, and no "Reverend Alan Bax"—but that the pretence is completely harmless. Alan shows Gwen the old church, now a ruin, as he walks her home. He confesses to her that he is not really a priest—"I wanted to enter the Church, but I failed." He notes that he does not try to persuade anyone or officiate, but sometimes wears the priestly collar "for security." Gwen tries to find out more about why the old church was left a ruin but Alan mysteriously turns silent and seems to be unable to move, so she says good night and leaves him to his thoughts. 
Question: What is the full name of the person who wears a priestly collar for security?
Response list: ['Alan Bax.']

Input: Passage: Edward Dalyngrigge was a younger son and thus deprived of his father's estates through the practice of primogeniture, hence he had to make his own fortunes. By 1378, he owned the manor of Bodiam by marrying into a land-owning family. From 1379 to 1388, Dalyngrigge was a Knight of the Shire for Sussex and one of the most influential people in the county. By the time he applied to the king for a licence to crenellate (build a castle), the Hundred Years' War had been fought between England and France for nearly 50 years. Edward III of England (reigned 1327–1377) pressed his claim for the French throne and secured the territories of Aquitaine and Calais. Dalyngrigge was one of many Englishmen who travelled to France to seek their fortune as members of Free Companies – groups of mercenaries who fought for the highest bidder. He left for France in 1367 and journeyed with Lionel, Duke of Clarence and son of Edward III. After fighting under the Earl of Arundel, Dalyngrigge joined the company of Sir Robert Knolles, a notorious commander who was reputed to have made 100,000 gold crowns as a mercenary from pillage and plunder. It was as a member of the Free Companies that Dalyngrigge raised the money to build Bodiam Castle; he returned to England in 1377.The Treaty of Bruges (1375) ensured peace for two years, but after it expired, fighting resumed between England and France. In 1377 Edward III was succeeded by Richard II. During the war, England and France struggled for control of the English Channel, with raids on both coasts. With the renewed hostilities, Parliament voted that money should be spent on defending and fortifying England's south coast, and defences were erected in Kent in anticipation of a French invasion. There was internal unrest as well as external threats, and Dalyngrigge was involved in suppressing the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. The manor of Bodiam was granted a charter in 1383 permitting a weekly market and an annual fair to be held. In 1385, a fleet of 1,200 ships – variously cogs, barges, and galleys – gathered across the English Channel at Sluys, Flanders; the population of southern England was in a state of panic. Later in the year, Edward Dalyngrigge was granted a licence to fortify his manor house.

Input: Passage: Carl Schaffner is a crooked British (previously German) businessman who flees to Mexico after stealing company funds. While travelling by train, Schaffner decides to evade authorities. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff. Carl later discovers that Scarff is wanted in Mexico as a political assassin. Carl then tracks down Scarff, who is resting from his injuries, to get back his original passport. Carl arrives in Mexico and is captured by the local police, who mistake him for Scarff. Carl then fights to show his true identity to the local police.  The plan seems foolproof until he is forced to care for the dog of Scarff's dog. The local police chief and Scotland Yard inspector Hadden conspire to keep him trapped in the Mexican border town of Katrina in an effort to get him to cross the bridge back into the U.S. and face justice. The misanthropic Schaffner has grown attached to Scarff's pet spaniel and is tricked into going across the dividing line of the bridge to get the dog. He is accidentally killed trying to escape the authorities. The final irony is that the discovery of his own humanity has cost the cynical, friendless Schaffner his life.

Input: Passage: Of the main characters, only Otho is not morally contemptible. Agrippina is an unscrupulous schemer; Nero, while not yet the monster he would become, is pampered and hypocritical; Claudius is pompous, complacent, and something of a buffoon, while Poppaea, the first of Handel's sex kittens, is also a liar and a flirt. The freedmen Pallas and Narcissus are self-serving and salacious. All, however, have some redeeming features, and all have arias that express genuine emotion. The situations in which they find themselves are sometimes comic, but never farcical—like Mozart in the Da Ponte operas, Handel avoids laughing at his characters.In Agrippina the da capo aria is the musical form used to illustrate character in the context of the opera. The first four arias of the work exemplify this: Nero's "Con raggio", in a minor key and with a descending figure on the key phrase "il trono ascenderò" ("I will ascend the throne") characterises him as weak and irresolute. Pallas's first aria "La mia sorte fortunata", with its "wide-leaping melodic phrasing" introduces him as a bold, heroic figure, contrasting with his rival Narcissus whose introspective nature is displayed in his delicate aria "Volo pronto" which immediately follows. Agrippina's introductory aria "L'alma mia" has a mock-military form which reflects her outward power, while subtle musical phrasing establishes her real emotional state. Poppaea's arias are uniformly light and rhythmic, while Claudius's short love song "Vieni O cara" gives a glimpse of his inner feelings, and is considered one of the gems of the score. 
Question: What are the names of the characters who are considered morally contemptible?

Input: Passage: Switchboard operator Marie Lawson is conned by admirer Nicky, who tells her it is just a practical joke, into redirecting a phone call. However, Nicky uses what he learns to his own benefit, costing the intended recipient a lot of money. When the victim complains to Marie's boss, telephone repairmen Terry Riley and John are called in to see if the phone was tapped. When it is found not to be, Marie loses her job.
Terry is attracted to Marie and eventually talks her into a date. He also gets her hired by businessman John P. Schuyler, whom he had earlier saved from a live electrical wire.
When Marie runs into Nicky later, she lets slip that her new employer is expecting a delivery of $90,000 in bonds. As a result, Nicky is able to fool the courier into thinking he is Schuyler and giving him the bonds while Marie is distracted by a flood of calls from his accomplices. When she realizes what has happened, she goes looking for Nicky, but this only serves to make her look guilty. Terry is questioned by the police and then released so he can lead them to her hiding place. It works and she is arrested.
When an expensive lawyer shows up on her behalf, Terry becomes suspicious and taps his line with John's reluctant help. Finally, he is able to trace a call to where Nicky and his gang are hiding out. When he goes there, he is easily caught and placed in a bedroom after the phone is ripped out. However, he is not searched. He hooks up a spare phone he has and is able to contact John to bring help. The crooks are captured.
Terry and Marie get married, but on their wedding night, many of Terry's co-workers show up to "repair" their phone.

Input: Passage: Sherman McCoy is a Wall Street bond trader who makes millions while enjoying the good life and the sexual favors of Maria Ruskin, a Southern belle gold digger. Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and find themselves in the "war-zone" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire out of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers. The two drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed.
Meanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White, almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the owner of the car, and therefore presumed to be the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City. As Sherman is brought to his knees, New York City fragments into different factions who use the case to suit their own cynical purposes.

Input: Passage: During an expedition into Central Africa, paleontologist Dr. Susan Matthews-Loomis and her husband George Loomis attempt to track down evidence of a local monster legend. The monster, which the local natives refer to as Mokele-mbembe, shares many characteristics with the Sauropod order of dinosaurs. During the expedition, they discover Brontosaurs in the deep jungle and are further amazed when the animals show very little fear of them. The couple begins observing the creatures and become especially enamored with the curious young offspring of the pair, whom they nickname "Baby". Unfortunately, the discovery soon places the dinosaurs in jeopardy from both the local military as well as fellow scientist Dr. Eric Kiviat. 
Whereas Dr. Kiviat sees Baby and his parents as his ticket to fame & fortune, the African military led by Colonel Nsogbu sees the dinosaurs as a threat and makes several attempts to destroy them. During one such attempt, one of the adult Brontosaurs is killed and the other captured. The Loomises are able to escape with Baby, but quickly find themselves lost in the jungle while being pursued by Colonel Nsogbu's forces. After finally escaping their pursuers, the pair decide to circle back and rescue the captive parent, whom Dr. Kiviat has persuaded Nsogbu to transport back to civilization.
With the aid of the local tribe - who see Baby and his parents as legends - George and Susan are able to break into the military compound and release the adult Brontosaur. During the escape, both Kiviat and Nsogbu are killed. Afterwards, the Loomises take the pair to a secluded jungle lagoon and say a tearful goodbye to Baby as he follows his lone parent away into the deeper parts of the jungle.

Input: Passage: Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death.
The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts.
In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United States between 1948 and 1950 and her many visits to continental Europe.
Ferrier was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 1951. In between periods of hospitalisation and convalescence she continued to perform and record; her final public appearance was as Orfeo, at the Royal Opera House in February 1953, eight months before her death. Among her many memorials, the Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund was launched in May 1954.  The Kathleen Ferrier Scholarship Fund, administered by the Royal Philharmonic Society, has since 1956 made annual awards to aspiring young professional singers. 
Question: What is the last name of the person who took singing lessons?

Input: Passage: The Stooges are wannabe detectives who inadvertently get their chance to crack a case in Scotland. They manage to stumble on a lead concerning the priceless Punjab diamond being stolen by a crook named Dapper. With dreams of becoming genuine detectives, the trio head for Squid McGuffy's cafe asking for the whereabouts of Dapper. They manage to convince everyone at the restaurant that they are actually police.
While searching several rooms above the cafe, the Stooges stumble on Dapper's moll, who hastily hides the Punjab diamond in a candy dish. The boys refuse to leave, suspecting Dapper will eventually show his face. While killing time, Shemp starts to flirt with the moll, and manages to swallow the ice along with some mints from the candy dish. The gal nearly has a nervous breakdown but quickly discovers the Stooges are not actually real detectives. She calls in Dapper and his henchman Muscles and frantically try to pry the diamond out of frazzled Shemp.
After all else fails, Dapper decides to cut him open. Moe and Larry are locked in a closet by Muscles while Shemp is tied down on a close by desk-turned-operating table. As luck would have it, there happen to be a bag of tools in the closet, which Moe and Larry use to saw their way out of the closet, and right into a gorilla's cage on the other side of the wall. The gorilla knocks Moe, Larry, Dapper and Muscles cold. The beast, however, befriends Shemp, and helps him cough up the diamond. Moments later, Shemp explains how he managed to swallow the diamond by actually doing so again. 
Question: Who swallows the Punjab diamond?

Input: Passage: As the British fleet closed with the opposing combined fleets of France and Spain, Lord Nelson signalled all the necessary battle instructions to his ships. Aware of the momentousness of events to come, Lord Nelson felt that something extra was required. He instructed his signal officer, Lieutenant John Pasco, to signal to the fleet, as quickly as possible, the message "England confides that every man will do his duty." Pasco suggested to Nelson that expects be substituted for confides (i.e. is confident), since the former word was in the signal book, whereas confides would have to be spelt out letter-by-letter. Nelson agreed to the change (even though it produced a less trusting impression):
His Lordship came to me on the poop, and after ordering certain signals to be made, about a quarter to noon, he said, 'Mr. Pasco, I wish to say to the fleet, ENGLAND CONFIDES THAT EVERY MAN WILL DO HIS DUTY' and he added 'You must be quick, for I have one more to make which is for close action.' I replied, 'If your Lordship will permit me to substitute the confides for expects the signal will soon be completed, because the word expects is in the vocabulary, and confides must be spelt,' His Lordship replied, in haste, and with seeming satisfaction, 'That will do, Pasco, make it directly.'
Thus, at around 11:45 a.m. on 21 October 1805, the signal was sent. The exact time the signal was sent is not known (one account puts it as early as 10:30), as the message was repeated throughout the fleet, but Pasco puts it at "about a quarter to noon" and logs from other ships of the line also put it close to this time. 
Question: What is the full name of the person who came to Pasco on the poop, and ordered certain signals to be made, about a quarter to noon?

Input: Passage: By the late 1950s, Covent Garden was gradually abandoning its policy of productions in the vernacular; such singers as Maria Callas would not relearn their roles in English. This made it easier for Tucker to point up the difference between the two London opera companies. While Covent Garden engaged international stars, Sadler's Wells focused on young British and Commonwealth performers. Colin Davis was appointed musical director in succession to Gibson in 1961. The repertoire continued to mix familiar and unfamiliar operas. Novelties in Davis's time included Pizzetti's Murder in the Cathedral, Stravinsky's Oedipus rex, Richard Rodney Bennett's The Mines of Sulphur and more Janáček. Sadler's Wells's traditional policy of giving all operas in English continued, with only two exceptions: Oedipus rex, which was sung in Latin, and Monteverdi's L'Orfeo, sung in Italian, for reasons not clear to the press. In January 1962, the company gave its first Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Iolanthe, on the day on which the Savoy operas came out of copyright and the D'Oyly Carte monopoly ended.  The production was well received (it was successfully revived for many seasons until 1978) and was followed by a production of The Mikado in May of the same year.The Islington theatre was by now clearly too small to allow the company to achieve any further growth. A study conducted for the Arts Council reported that in the late 1960s the two Sadler's Wells companies comprised 278 salaried performers and 62 guest singers. The company had experience of playing in a large West End theatre, such as its 1958 sell-out production of The Merry Widow that had transferred to the 2,351-seat London Coliseum for a summer season. Ten years later, the lease of the Coliseum became available.  Stephen Arlen, who had succeeded Tucker as managing director, was the primary advocate for moving the company. After intense negotiations and fund-raising, a ten-year lease was signed in 1968.  One of the company's last productions at the Islington theatre was Wagner's The Mastersingers, conducted by Goodall in 1968, which 40 years later was described by Gramophone magazine as "legendary". The company left Sadler's Wells with a revival of the work with which it had re-opened the theatre in 1945, Peter Grimes. Its last performance at the Rosebery Avenue theatre was on 15 June 1968. 
Question: What are the names of the people that composed The Mikado?

Input: Passage: In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: "But the lack of this aural stimulation – of Shakespeare's eloquent words – is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: "Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order."A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony.
Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence and music himself, even when his right hand was virtually unusable. This is a last hallmark of his extraordinarily determined and tenacious character.
He was survived by his third wife, Irina; his daughter, Galina; and his son, Maxim, a pianist and conductor who was the dedicatee and first performer of some of his father's works. Shostakovich himself left behind several recordings of his own piano works; other noted interpreters of his music include Emil Gilels, Mstislav Rostropovich, Tatiana Nikolayeva, Maria Yudina, David Oistrakh, and members of the Beethoven Quartet.
His last work was his Viola Sonata, which was first performed on 28 December 1975, four months after his death. 
Question: What is the last name of the person whose legs were both broken in several falls?
Response list: ['Shostakovich.']
Ground truth: Shostakovich.

Input: Passage: Sir Michael Kemp Tippett  (2 January 1905 – 8 January 1998) was an English composer who rose to prominence during and immediately after the  Second World War. In his lifetime he was sometimes  ranked with his contemporary Benjamin Britten as one of the leading British composers of the 20th century. Among his best-known works are the oratorio A Child of Our Time, the orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, and the opera The Midsummer Marriage.
Tippett's talent developed slowly. He withdrew or destroyed his earliest compositions, and was 30 before any of his works were published. Until the mid-to-late 1950s his music was broadly lyrical in character, before changing to a more astringent and experimental style. New influences, including those of jazz and blues after his first visit to America in 1965, became increasingly evident in his compositions. While Tippett's stature with the public continued to grow, not all critics approved of these changes in style, some believing that the quality of his work suffered as a consequence. From around 1976 Tippett's late works began to reflect the works of his youth through a return to lyricism. Although he was much honoured in his lifetime, critical judgement on Tippett's legacy has been uneven, the greatest praise being generally reserved for his earlier works. His centenary in 2005 was a muted affair; apart from the few best-known works, his music has been performed  infrequently in the 21st century.
Having briefly embraced communism in the 1930s, Tippett avoided identifying with any political party. A pacifist after 1940, he was imprisoned in 1943 for refusing to carry out war-related duties required by his military exemption. His initial difficulties in accepting his  homosexuality led him in 1939 to Jungian psychoanalysis; the Jungian dichotomy of "shadow" and "light" remained a recurring factor in his music. He was a strong advocate of music education, and was active for much of his life as a radio broadcaster and writer on music. 
Question: What is the last name of the person who was 30 before any of his works were published?
Response list: ['Tippett.']
Ground truth: Tippett.

Robbie Burns' poem "The Yellow, Yellow Yorlin'" gets its title from a Scottish name for the yellowhammer, which is given an obvious sexual connotation: I met a pretty maid, an' unto her I said,/ "I wad fain fin' your yellow, yellow yorlin'." More factual descriptions of the bird and its behaviour can be found in John Clare's "The Yellowhammer's Nest" and "The Yellowhammer", whose final lines read:
Enid Blyton helped to popularise the bird's song as "little bit of bread and no cheese" in books such as The Ship of Adventure and Five Go Off in a Caravan, and wrote a poem called "The Yellow-hammer".
Beethoven's student, Carl Czerny, and biographer Anton Schindler, both suggested that the composer got the idea for the first four notes of his 5th symphony from the yellowhammer's call, although it is more likely that the opening of the 4th Piano Concerto was actually the work in question. Beethoven also used the yellowhammer theme in two piano sonatas, no. 21 in C major (the "Waldstein", Op.53) and No. 23 in F minor (the "Appassionata", Op.57).Olivier Messiaen often used birdsong as an inspiration for his music, and the yellowhammer features in Chronochromie, Catalogue d'oiseaux, La fauvette des jardins and Méditations sur le mystère de la Sainte Trinité, appearing in four movements of the last piece.An old legend links the yellowhammer to the Devil. Its tongue was supposed to bear a drop of his blood, and the intricate pattern on the eggs was said to carry a concealed, possibly evil, message; these satanic associations sometimes led to the persecution of the bird. The unusual appearance of the eggs also led to "scribble lark", an old name for the bird. 
Question: What are the names of the two piano sonatas Beethoven used the yellowhammer theme in?
Response list: ['No. 21 in C major (the "Waldstein", Op.53).']
Ground truth: no. 21 in C major.

Input: Passage: When Mary Beekman loses her waitress job, after a fight with her loutish boyfriend, trucker Mike O'Reilly she stands at a bridge on a windy night, losing her pay check through a windblown and leans over the guardrail of the bridge to catch it. Socialite Kenneth Alden catches her, thinking she wants to jump the bridge. He's lost everything that is not already mortgaged. Both down on their luck, they assume that the other is there to jump off the bridge.
Instead, Mary has an idea. If Ken sells shares to a syndicate of his wealthy friends, in a phoney beauty product, they'll have enough money for some clothes to pass Mary off in society, long enough to meet and marry a wealthy bachelor. Then, they can pay everyone back, with interest. The con might work, except that Ken has too much integrity to marry for money to Clarissa (whom he loves for years), and Mary is beginning to see his point when she falls for Pat, who has secrets of his own.
The plot boils over when Mike shows up to blow the lid off. Pat's valet is a thief, who promised not to act foolishly. But he escapes with a stolen Tiara. Meantime Mary thinks to leave as things do not work out, so she shares the taxi to the station with Pat's valet escaping with the Tiara. After a police chase, Mary is hauled off to the station.
It looks like no one is going to end up with anything, but a bad reputation; but, it's not over yet, in this curious, romantic comedy, about the social set, in 1930's America, from Chesterfield films. 
Question: What is the first name of the person Kenneth Alden saves?

Input: Passage: "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" was written by Beyoncé, Terius "The-Dream" Nash, Thaddis "Kuk" Harrell, and Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized "Single Ladies" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was "the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that "people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate". She stated that although "Single Ladies" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In "Single Ladies", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce. The song was released simultaneously with "If I Were a Boy"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; "Single Ladies" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; "Single Ladies" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while "If I Were a Boy" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio. The two songs were released as a double A-side single on November 7, 2008, in Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. Dance remixes of the song were made available in the US on February 10, 2009, and in Europe on February 16, 2009. "Single Ladies" was not originally released as a single in the UK, but the song became increasingly popular there and reached the top ten in the UK Singles Chart as a result of download sales. On February 16, 2009, it was released as a CD single, and the dance remixes became available as a digital download.

Input: Passage: Teenaged brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World, a dinosaur theme park at the original Jurassic Park site on Isla Nublar. Their aunt, Claire Dearing, is the operations manager. Claire assigns her assistant, Zara, as the boys' guide but they soon evade her. Elsewhere on the island, U.S. Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady has been training and researching four Velociraptors. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, Vic Hoskins, the head of InGen Security, believes the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant Barry strongly oppose.
Prior to its opening, Claire and park owner Simon Masrani inspect the park's newest attraction, Indominus rex, a genetically-engineered dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure. Owen warns Claire the Indominus lacks social skills, making it more dangerous and unpredictable. When it appears the Indominus has escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. The Indominus, which can camouflage itself and mask its heat signature, suddenly appears. Owen survives the attack, but it kills the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Owen tells Masrani to have the Indominus killed; to protect his company's investment, Masrani instead dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with non-lethal weaponry. After most of the unit is wiped out, Claire orders the evacuation of the island's northern sector.

Input: Passage: Balch Creek begins in the Forest Park neighborhood in unincorporated Multnomah County near the intersection of Northwest Skyline Boulevard and Northwest Thompson Road at the crest of the West Hills. It flows generally east about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) to its confluence with the Willamette River, a major tributary of the Columbia River. The creek drops from 1,116 feet (340 m) above sea level at its source to 46 feet (14 m) at its mouth, a total of 1,070 feet (330 m). Most of this occurs in the first 2.5 miles (4.0 km). In the hills, the stream gradient (slope) generally ranges from 15 to 30 percent interspersed with sections of less than 15 percent along the middle reaches.From its source, the creek runs east on private property near Forest Park, a large municipal park in Portland, before turning briefly south about 3 miles (5 km) from the mouth. Soon thereafter, the stream receives an unnamed tributary on the right bank and turns southeast on private property along Northwest Cornell Road. It enters the city and the Audubon Society of Portland simultaneously about 2 miles (3 km) from the mouth, receives two more unnamed tributaries on the right, and flows northeast, entering the part of Forest Park known as Macleay Park.For about 0.25 miles (0.40 km) the creek parallels Wildwood Trail, the main hiking trail in Forest Park, until reaching a former public restroom known as the Stone House. From here Balch Creek runs beside the Lower Macleay Trail, another hiking trail, for about 0.8 miles (1.3 km). Near Northwest Thurman Street, roughly 1 mile (1.6 km) from the mouth, the creek flows through a trash rack into an 84-inch (210 cm) diameter storm sewer. City workers first diverted the creek into a pipe in the early 20th century. The water empties into the Willamette River in the city's Northwest Industrial neighborhood at Outfall 17. About 10 miles (16 km) below this outfall, the Willamette enters the Columbia River.

Input: Passage: The wide variety of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has been found to be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 discovered the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).Fish are plentiful in the waters surrounding the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African red snappers (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.
The sandbar of Carabane has very few mammals other than pets, although the French first noted the presence of monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.On an island called Ilha dos Mosquitos (Portuguese for "Mosquito Island"), the natives and their visitors continue to protect themselves with mosquito nets and Shea butter. They must also protect themselves from other, smaller insects which are no less troublesome: black flies (Simulium).

Input: Passage: Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi (Italian: [ˈklaudjo monteˈverdi] (listen); 15 May 1567 (baptized) – 29 November 1643) was an Italian composer, string player and choirmaster. A composer of both secular and sacred music, and a pioneer in the development of opera, he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque periods of music history.
Born in Cremona, where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua (c. 1590–1613) and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was maestro di capella at the basilica of San Marco. His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period, including problems of income, patronage and politics.
Much of Monteverdi's output, including many stage works, has been lost. His surviving music includes nine books of madrigals, large-scale sacred works such as his Vespro della Beata Vergine (Vespers) of 1610, and three complete operas. His opera L'Orfeo (1607) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed; towards the end of his life he wrote works for the commercial theatre in Venice, including Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione di Poppea.
While he worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance polyphony, such as in his madrigals, he undertook great developments in form and melody, and began to employ the basso continuo technique, distinctive of the Baroque. No stranger to controversy, he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a seconda pratica, contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the prima pratica. Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries, his works enjoyed a rediscovery around the beginning of the twentieth century. He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded.

Input: Passage: Matt Franklin is a recent MIT graduate who works at a Los Angeles Suncoast Video store in 1988 while trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life, something that his police officer father has grown impatient with. While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home.
Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesn't think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend graduate school at the University of Cambridge. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in Beverly Hills. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along. Barry has a wild sexual encounter with an older woman while Matt and Tori continue to mingle with each other, after Matt's successful 'put down' of Tori's boss, a habitual sexual harasser. They leave the party to go into a neighbor's backyard where they jump on a trampoline, play truth or dare, and end up having sex.

Input: Passage: Sitting in deckchairs and touring churches is not the holiday 17-year-old Richard wants, but his parents insist on taking him. They are staying at the Tregarron guesthouse in the (fictional) seaside town of Easton in Suffolk. This traditional English boarding house is owned and run by the formidable  Miss Wilbraham.   
On arrival, Richard befriends Edwin, who is girl-crazy and takes Richard under his wing. In search of girls, Richard and Edwin attend a beach service organized by the local church  youth group. After the type of evening one might expect at such a gathering, they enjoy a brief tryst with the twin daughters of the minister.

Input: Passage: Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had "a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, "Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford." While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

Input: Passage: Their records have been heavily influenced by the "motorik" technique of 1970s krautrock groups such as Neu! and Faust. Tim Gane has supported the comparison: "Neu! did minimalism and drones, but in a very pop way." Dave Heaton of PopMatters said that their music also had "echoes of bubblegum, of exotica, of Beach Boys and bossa nova", with their earlier work "bearing strong Velvet Underground overtones". Funk, jazz, and Brazilian music were additional inspirations for the band. Stephan Davet of French newspaper Le Monde said that Emperor Tomato Ketchup (1996) had musical influences such as Burt Bacharach, and Françoise Hardy. The sounds influenced by minimalist composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich can be found on the 1999 album Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night. The same album, according to Rick Reger of Chicago Tribune, "charts [a course] somewhere between the Beach Boys and Kraftwerk." Stereolab's style also incorporates easy-listening music of the 1950s and '60s. Barney Hoskyns wrote in a review for Dots and Loops (1997) that the group moved "away from the one-chord Velvets drone-mesh of its early days" toward easy-listening and Europop. Joshua Klein in Washington Post said that, "Years before everyone else caught on, Stereolab [were] referencing the 1970s German bands Can and Neu!, the Mexican lounge music master Esquivel and the decidedly unhip Burt Bacharach." Regarding their later work such as Instant 0 in the Universe (2003) and Margerine Eclipse (2004), critics have compared the releases to the band's earlier guitar-driven style.

Input: Passage: Oliver was born Bronwyn Gooda on 22 February 1959, in Gum Flat, west of Inverell, in New South Wales. Her parents were Milton, a farmer turned greenkeeper, and Wendy, who worked in a pharmacy. Her creativity was nurtured from a young age. Aged just eight, Oliver attended weekend art classes in Inverell run by Ian Howard, who went on to become dean of the college in Sydney where she would later study. As she was dux of her school, her parents expected her to go on to university. However, Oliver wished to pursue a creative career. When she told her parents of her plans, her mother replied, "Darling, your father and I are very pleased you're going to art school, but if you'd been a son, I think we'd be a little disappointed." A rift subsequently developed between her and her family that resulted in her having no contact with them for 25 years.After leaving school, Oliver studied and worked in Sydney. She had intended to enrol in painting classes, but a computer error placed her in the sculpture course: she later said "I knew straight away I was in the right place".She graduated from the Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education in 1980. Winning a New South Wales Travelling Art Scholarship in 1983, she then completed a master's degree at Chelsea School of Art in 1984. Her work was influenced by Richard Deacon, Antony Gormley and Martin Puryear under whom she studied while in England. Upon returning from the United Kingdom, she immediately met with further success, when in 1984 she won a Moet & Chandon Australian Art Fellowship. In 1988 she was granted a period as artist-in-residence in the city of Brest on the coast of Brittany, where she studied Celtic metalworking techniques.

Gogol becomes a lazy, pot smoking teenager indifferent to his cultural background. He resents many of the customs and traditions his family upholds and doesn't understand his parents. After a summer trip to India before starting college at Yale, Gogol starts opening up to his culture and becomes more accepting of it. 
After college, Gogol uses his "good name" Nikhil (later shortened to Nick). He works as an architect and dates Maxine, a white woman from a wealthy background, who is clueless about their cultural differences. Gogol falls in love with Maxine and introduces her to his parents, who struggle to understand his modern, American perspectives on dating, marriage and love. They are hesitant and guarded when meeting her. Gogol gets along with Maxine's family and feels closer to them than he does his own family. 
Question: What is the name of the person who resents many of his customs and traditions?

Input: Passage: The Rwandan government, through its Sports Development Policy, promotes sport as a strong avenue for "development and peace building", and the government has made commitments to advancing the use of sport for a variety of development objectives, including education. The most popular sports in Rwanda are association football, volleyball, basketball, athletics and Paralympic sports. Cricket has been growing in popularity, as a result of refugees returned from Kenya, where they had learned to play the game. Cycling, traditionally seen largely as a mode of transport in Rwanda, is also growing in popularity as a sport; and Team Rwanda have been the subject of a book, Land of Second Chances: The Impossible Rise of Rwanda's Cycling Team and a film, Rising from Ashes.Rwandans have been competing at the Olympic Games since 1984, and the Paralympic Games since 2004. The country sent seven competitors to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, representing it in athletics, swimming, mountain biking and judo, and 15 competitors to the London Summer Paralympics to compete in athletics, powerlifting and sitting volleyball. The country has also participated in the Commonwealth Games since joining the Commonwealth in 2009. The country's national basketball team has been growing in prominence since the mid-2000s, with the men's team qualifying for the final stages of the African Basketball Championship four times in a row since 2007. The country bid unsuccessfully to host the 2013 tournament. Rwanda's national football team has appeared in the African Cup of Nations once, in the 2004 edition of the tournament, but narrowly failed to advance beyond the group stages. The team have failed to qualify for the competition since, and have never qualified for the World Cup. Rwanda's highest domestic football competition is the Rwanda National Football League; as of 2015, the dominant team is APR FC of Kigali, having won 13 of the last 17 championships. Rwandan clubs participate in the Kagame Interclub Cup for Central and East African teams, sponsored since 2002 by President Kagame.

Input: Passage: Fodor's Chicago 2010 ranks the hotel as having one of the best spas and one of the best pools in the city. It also ranked the hotel as a Fodor's Choice among Chicago lodging options.  Fodor's also notes that the hotel has impeccable service and lavish amenities, but also notes that the hotel may be a bit "too decadent", with offerings such as $25 bottles of water.Frommer's Chicago 2010 describes the hotel as having the gorgeous views and upscale amenities to provide a place to go to live the life of a wealthy tourist. The building is praised for its location, which provides as many views along the Chicago River as possible. Its modern architecture is praised for "contemporary synthesis of adjacent building fabrics and modulations" that preserve the city's architectural heritage and integrate the riverfront setting.BlackBook Magazine's Guide to Chicago describes the Hotel as an embodiment of poshness which gives the visitor bragging rights upon his/her return home.Forbes Travel Guide describes the hotel as having an understated upscale lobby, sophisticated lounge, gorgeous restaurant and lavish rooms with amazing views.  It also describes the hotel as befitting of the Trump name in several ways.Time Out describes the building as a "testament to a vibrant 21st-century optimism in Chicago". It notes that the hotel meets all expectations attached to the name Trump in terms of luxury, modern conveniences and speaks highly of the views.Insight Guides describes the building's architectural swagger as fitting for the post-September 11 attacks skyline. Ten years after the September 11 attacks, Kamin described the building as the one that "best reveals how the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks either did or did not change architecture". Kamin clarified his belief:
Simply by virtue of standing there—and by being the tallest American building built since the 1974 completion of Sears (now Willis) Tower—Trump confounds those who predicted after 9/11 that iconic skyscrapers would never be built again. At the same time, Trump's height—originally pegged at more than 2,000 feet but eventually scaled back to 1,362 feet—suggests that the fear spawned by the attacks did have some effect.

Input: Passage: Agent Bart Langner finds Elsa Brinkmann, a would-be actress who looks and sounds just like  Lylah Clare, a flamboyant star who fell to her death in suspicious circumstances 20 years ago. He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan, who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah. 
Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella. As filming continues, her identification with her rôle gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished. 
By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella.
A final sequence (in this case, a TV commercial for dog food that interrupts the film itself) suggests that the world of Hollywood is literally one of dog eats dog.

Input: Passage: Karluk had been chosen by Pedersen and bought by Stefansson for the bargain price of US$10,000. Stefansson was advised by Pedersen that, of four ships that were available, Karluk was "the soundest and best adapted for our purpose", but Bartlett had deep reservations about her fitness for prolonged Arctic service. The ship, a 29-year-old brigantine, was 129 feet (39 m) in length with a beam of 23 feet (7.0 m). She had been built for the Aleutian fishing industry (karluk is the Aleut word for "fish") and later converted for whaling, when her bows and sides had been sheathed with 2-inch (51 mm) Australian ironwood. Despite 14 arctic whaling voyages, including six overwinterings, she had not been built to withstand sustained ice pressure, and lacked the engine power to force a passage through the ice. She did not match the expectations of Bartlett, or of many of the more experienced crew.The ship spent most of April and May 1913 undergoing repairs and refitting at the dockyard in Esquimalt. When Bartlett arrived in early June he immediately ordered further repair work. In addition to Karluk, Stefansson had purchased sight unseen a small gasoline-driven schooner, Alaska, to act as a supply ship for the Southern Party. He later added a second schooner, Mary Sachs, when the hold space in Alaska proved inadequate. In the confusion surrounding the expedition's departure, McKinlay notes, no attempt was made to align men or equipment to their appropriate ships. Thus anthropologists Henri Beuchat and Diamond Jenness, both designated for the Southern Party, found themselves sailing with Karluk, while their equipment was on board Alaska. McKinlay himself, aboard Karluk as magnetic observer, discovered that most of his equipment was with Alaska. Stefansson insisted that all would be sorted out when the ships reached their Herschel Island rendezvous. "Heaven help us all if we failed to reach Herschel Island", McKinlay wrote. 
Question: What were the names of the three ships bought by Stefansson?

Input: Passage: After their HIV positive mother's death, Derick and Margaret collect wood and construct a human-length box with wheels. Then, they journey with it from Kampala to Kasangombe in a heartbreaking bid to overcome poverty and experience hope. The journey throws them dangerous experiences on unpredictable Ugandan roads. Their mother's dying wish had set them off on a seemingly impossible journey to find a relative they do not even know.
Before her death, she leaves them an envelope addressed to her sister (their auntie) who is married to a hard-working man living in a distant village called Kasangombe with their kids. Ingeniously, Derick creates a coffin using wood he collected from a rubbish dump and adds luggage bag rollers brought by Margaret. On their journey from Kampala City to their aunt's place, they are offered a lift by a seemingly kind man (played by Joel Okuyo Atiku) in a truck who is amazed by their "box". He introduces them to a kid he had taken under his wings relaxing at the back and shows them a photo of a house they can possess if they work for him. At night though, Margaret sees a scary dream where their helper is not exactly as kind as he seemed so she runs out of the truck. Derick follows and the boy throws out their coffin before waving. They walk the rest of the distance.
Initially, their uncle (played by Isaac Muwawu) did not want them in his house because he thought they were HIV-infected. Derick overheard him quarrel with his aunt at night and shook Margaret in the morning from another dream (this time beautiful, where both siblings were smiling and enjoying a picnic in a glorious garden with their aunt, uncle, cousins, dead parents and some whites). Derick convinced her to walk away from the home with him but without a reason.

Input: Passage: Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his Bar Mitzvah. Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the New York-based Jewish Defense League. Time magazine quoted him saying about Kahane, "He's a really sincere guy. He's really put it all together." Subsequently, Dylan downplayed the extent of his contact with Kahane.
During the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the Vineyard School of Discipleship. Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: "Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord." From January to March 1979, Dylan attended the Vineyard Bible study classes in Reseda, California.By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the "born again" label. He told Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone magazine: "I've never said I'm born again. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come." In response to Loder's asking whether he belonged to any church or synagogue, Dylan laughingly replied, "Not really. Uh, the Church of the Poison Mind."When it was asked of Dylan in a 1986 press conference in Australia "How much do you feel you are a vessel, a medium for a higher power, for God, that it [the music] flows through you... for Him?" Dylan replied, "Well I feel that way about most of the stuff that I do."In 1997, he told David Gates of Newsweek:
Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else. Songs like "Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain" or "I Saw the Light"—that's my religion. I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.

Input: Passage: Ray Dolezal, a bored Torrance County Deputy Sheriff, is called to the scene of an apparent suicide in the desert. Alongside the body of Bob Spencer is a suitcase containing $500,000.  During the autopsy, they find a digested piece of paper with a phone number; Dolezal, posing as Spencer, calls the number and goes to a meeting, where he is robbed and instructed to meet Gorman Lennox at a restaurant. FBI agent Greg Meeker intercepts Dolezal and informs him that Spencer was an undercover agent. Now that Dolezal has lost the money, Meeker suggests he continue posing as Spencer to recover the money or help arrest Lennox.
Dolezal meets Lennox and his wealthy associate Lane Bodine and learns the money is intended for the purchase of unused military weaponry to arm left-wing freedom fighters in South America.  The arms dealers demo the guns for Dolezal and Lennox, but demand an additional $250,000 due to unforeseen expenses; Meeker, unwilling to provide more money, pushes the responsibility on Dolezal, who romances his way into Lane's life so she will attract rich humanitarian donors to fund the deal. Meanwhile, two FBI internal affairs agents suspect Dolezal of killing Spencer and stealing the money. Dolezal is forced to admit to Lane he is not really Spencer, but she agrees to help raise the money because she finds Dolezal a better alternative to the volatile Lennox.
Dolezal learns from Noreen, who had an affair with the real Spencer, that he was working with an FBI agent who likely killed him. Noreen runs away at the sight of Meeker and the internal affairs agents grab Dolezal.  Lennox runs the agents off the road; Dolezal flees and returns to Lane.  He discovers Noreen shot dead and a Polaroid of her with Spencer and Meeker.

Input: Passage: (English: "The Marriage of Thetis")
After Duke Vincenzo's death in February 1612, Monteverdi found himself out of favour at the Mantuan court. Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide "if you tell me to do so". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi. He informed Striggio that what he had first considered a rather monotonous piece he now thought fully appropriate to the occasion. He began work on the recitative sections, but before he could start setting the more expressive numbers, the duke had a change of heart and cancelled Monteverdi's commission. Le nozze di Tetide was abandoned; its libretto and whatever music existed have disappeared. 
Question: What is the last name of the person who remained in contact with Striggio?
Response list: ['Monteverdi.']
Ground truth: Monteverdi.

Input: Passage: In the 14th century, diplomatic contact continued between the Franks and the Mongols, until the Ilkhanate dissolved in the 1330s, and the ravages of the Black Death in Europe caused contact with the East to be severed. A few marital alliances between Christian rulers and the Mongols of the Golden Horde continued, such as when the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II gave daughters in marriage to Toqto'a (d. 1312) and later to his successor Uzbek (1312–1341).After Abu Sa'id, relations between Christian princes and the Ilkhanate became very sparse. Abu Sa'id died in 1335 with neither heir nor successor, and the Ilkhanate lost its status after his death, becoming a plethora of little kingdoms run by Mongols, Turks, and Persians.In 1336, an embassy to the French Pope Benedict XII in Avignon was sent by Toghun Temür, the last Yuan emperor in Dadu. The embassy was led by two Genoese travelers in the service of the Mongol emperor, who carried letters representing that the Mongols had been eight years (since Archbishop John of Montecorvino's death) without a spiritual guide, and earnestly desired one. Pope Benedict appointed four ecclesiastics as his legates to the khan's court. In 1338, a total of 50 ecclesiastics were sent by the pope to Peking, among them John of Marignolli, who returned to Avignon in 1353 with a letter from the Yuan emperor to Pope Innocent VI. But soon, the Han Chinese rose up and drove the Mongols out of China, establishing the Ming Dynasty in 1368. By 1369, all foreign influences, from Mongols to Christians, Manichaeans, and Buddhists, were expelled by the Ming Dynasty.
In the early 15th century, Timur (Tamerlane) resumed relations with Europe, attempting to form an alliance against the Egyptian Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire, and engaged in communications with Charles VI of France and Henry III of Castile, but died in 1405. 
Question: What was the name of one of the 50 ecclesiastics sent by the pope to Peking who returned to Avignon in 1353 with a letter from the Yuan emperor to Pope Innocent VI?

Input: Passage: John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself "Anglus" or "Scotus", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest.  A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a "Mighell Wryghtt", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as "Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as "related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland." If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas. 
Question: What is the first name of the person who had at least one son with his wife?
Response list: ['Thomas.']

Input: Passage: In his usurpation of the throne from the Jianwen Emperor (r. 1398–1402), the Yongle Emperor was aided by the Buddhist monk Yao Guangxiao, and like his father, the Hongwu Emperor, the Yongle Emperor was "well-disposed towards Buddhism", claims Rossabi. On March 10, 1403, the Yongle Emperor invited Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama (1384–1415), to his court, even though the fourth Karmapa had rejected the invitation of the Hongwu Emperor. A Tibetan translation in the 16th century preserves the letter of the Yongle Emperor, which the Association for Asian Studies notes is polite and complimentary towards the Karmapa. The letter of invitation reads,My father and both parents of the queen are now dead. You are my only hope, essence of buddhahood. Please come quickly. I am sending as offering a large ingot of silver, one hundred fifty silver coins, twenty rolls of silk, a block of sandalwood, one hundred fifty bricks of tea and ten pounds of incense."
In order to seek out the Karmapa, the Yongle Emperor dispatched his eunuch Hou Xian and the Buddhist monk Zhi Guang (d. 1435) to Tibet. Traveling to Lhasa either through Qinghai or via the Silk Road to Khotan, Hou Xian and Zhi Guang did not return to Nanjing until 1407.
The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC preserves an edict of the Zhengtong Emperor (r. 1435–1449) addressed to the Karmapa in 1445, written after the latter's agent had brought holy relics to the Ming court. Zhengtong had the following message delivered to the Great Treasure Prince of Dharma, the Karmapa:
Out of compassion, Buddha taught people to be good and persuaded them to embrace his doctrines. You, who live in the remote Western Region, have inherited the true Buddhist doctrines. I am deeply impressed not only by the compassion with which you preach among the people in your region for their enlightenment, but also by your respect for the wishes of Heaven and your devotion to the Court. I am very pleased that you have sent bSod-nams-nyi-ma and other Tibetan monks here bringing with them statues of Buddha, horses and other specialties as tributes to the court.
Despite this glowing message by the Emperor, Chan writes that a year later in 1446, the Ming court cut off all relations with the Karmapa hierarchs. Until then, the court was unaware that Deshin Shekpa had died in 1415. The Ming court had believed that the representatives of the Karma Kagyu who continued to visit the Ming capital were sent by the Karmapa.

Input: Passage: The book Elvis: What Happened?, co-written by the three bodyguards fired the previous year, was published on August 1. It was the first exposé to detail Presley's years of drug misuse. He was devastated by the book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to the publishers. By this point, he suffered from multiple ailments: glaucoma, high blood pressure, liver damage, and an enlarged colon, each magnified—and possibly caused—by drug abuse.On the evening of Tuesday, August 16, 1977, Presley was scheduled to fly out of Memphis to begin another tour. That afternoon, Ginger Alden discovered him in an unresponsive state on a bathroom floor. According to her eyewitness account, "Elvis looked as if his entire body had completely frozen in a seated position while using the commode and then had fallen forward, in that fixed position, directly in front of it. [...] It was clear that, from the time whatever hit him to the moment he had landed on the floor, Elvis hadn't moved." Attempts to revive him failed, and his death was officially pronounced at 3:30 p.m. at the Baptist Memorial Hospital.President Jimmy Carter issued a statement that credited Presley with having "permanently changed the face of American popular culture". Thousands of people gathered outside Graceland to view the open casket. One of Presley's cousins, Billy Mann, accepted $18,000 to secretly photograph the corpse; the picture appeared on the cover of the National Enquirer's biggest-selling issue ever. Alden struck a $105,000 deal with the Enquirer for her story, but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement. Presley left her nothing in his will.Presley's funeral was held at Graceland on Thursday, August 18. Outside the gates, a car plowed into a group of fans, killing two women and critically injuring a third. About 80,000 people lined the processional route to Forest Hill Cemetery, where Presley was buried next to his mother. Within a few weeks, "Way Down" topped the country and U.K. pop charts. Following an attempt to steal Presley's body in late August, the remains of both Presley and his mother were reburied in Graceland's Meditation Garden on October 2.

Input: Passage: Sailors on nearby ships heard the series of signals and, realizing that a collision was imminent, gathered to watch as Imo bore down on Mont-Blanc. Both ships had cut their engines by this point, but their momentum carried them right on top of each other at slow speed. Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock that would set off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered Mont-Blanc to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the bow of Imo in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship's height in the water and the transverse thrust of her right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into Mont-Blanc. Imo's prow pushed into the No. 1 hold of Mont Blanc, on her starboard side.The collision occurred at 8:45 am. The damage to Mont Blanc was not severe, but barrels of deck cargo toppled and broke open.  This flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imo's engines kicked in, she disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blanc's hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly up the side of the ship. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.Towing two scows at the time of the collision, Stella Maris responded immediately to the fire, anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6 to spray the burning ship with their fire hose. The tug's captain, Horatio H. Brannen, and his crew realized that the fire was too intense for their single hose and backed off from the burning Mont Blanc. They were approached by a whaler from HMS Highflyer and later a steam pinnace belonging to HMCS Niobe. Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of Niobe agreed to secure a line to the French ship's stern so as to pull it away from the pier to avoid setting it on fire. The five-inch (127-millimetre) hawser initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a ten-inch (254-millimetre) hawser came down. It was at this point that the blast occurred. 
Question: What is the last name of the captain that agreed to secure a line to the ship that the people of Halifax watched burn?
Response list: ['Brannen.']
Ground truth: Brannen.

Input: Passage: 4 received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 36 reviews. Michael Cragg of The Observer called it Beyoncé's "most accomplished album yet". Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson believed 4 succeeds vocally as an album of mostly intimate and slow-tempo ballads. Mikael Wood of Spin magazine applauded its ballads, mid-tempo songs, and evocations of late 1970s and early 1980s pop-soul. In his review for Rolling Stone, Jody Rosen wrote that Beyoncé eschews contemporary production styles for a more personal and idiosyncratic album. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times viewed it as a good showcase for Beyoncé as a torch singer, because she convincingly sings about heartbreak and the strong emotional effect of love. Pitchfork critic Ryan Dombal found it easygoing, retro-informed, and engaging because it shows "one of the world's biggest stars exploring her talent in ways few could've predicted". AllMusic's Andy Kellman said that the quality of Beyoncé's singing and the songwriting compensate for the assorted arrangement of the songs. Uncut viewed it is an exceptional album in spite of occasionally trite lyrics.In a less enthusiastic review, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly said the first half of 4 is marred by boring ballads and the songwriting in general are not on-par with Beyoncé's vocal talent. In his review for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis was ambivalent towards the album's 1980s influence and argued that, despite well written songs, it is not very consequential. Time magazine's Claire Suddath said the songs lack lyrical substance, even though they are performed well. Greg Kot, writing in the Chicago Tribune, called 4 inconsistent, short, and unfinished. NME magazine's Hamish MacBain felt Beyoncé did not progress from her past work and that "even the OK bits here" sounded "uninspired".

Input: Passage: An enchantress disguised as a beggar arrives at a French castle and offers a cruel and selfish prince a rose in return for shelter. When he refuses, she reveals her identity. To punish the prince for his lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the curse will only be broken if he learns to love another, and earn their love in return, before the last petal falls on his 21st birthday.
Ten years later, in a nearby village, a beautiful, young, book-loving woman named Belle dreams of adventure and brushes off advances from Gaston, a handsome, narcissistic and arrogant hunter. On his way to a fair and lost in the forest, Belle's father Maurice seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search for him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take Maurice's place.
Belle befriends the castle's servants, who invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. She is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, and is injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a friendship develops between them.

Input: Passage: As the national media descended on Beach Haven, Spring Lake, and Matawan, the Jersey Shore attacks started a shark panic. According to Capuzzo, this panic was "unrivaled in American history," "sweeping along the coasts of New York and New Jersey and spreading by telephone and wireless, letter and postcard." At first, after the Beach Haven incident, scientists and the press reluctantly blamed the death of Charles Vansant on a shark. The New York Times reported that Vansant "was badly bitten in the surf ... by a fish, presumably a shark." Still, State Fish Commissioner of Pennsylvania and former director of the Philadelphia Aquarium James M. Meehan asserted in the Philadelphia Public Ledger that the shark was preying on the dog, but bit Vansant by mistake. He specifically de-emphasized the threat sharks posed to humans:
Despite the death of Charles Vansant and the report that two sharks having been caught in that vicinity recently, I do not believe there is any reason why people should hesitate to go in swimming at the beaches for fear of man-eaters. The information in regard to the sharks is indefinite and I hardly believe that Vansant was bitten by a man-eater. Vansant was in the surf playing with a dog and it may be that a small shark had drifted in at high water, and was marooned by the tide. Being unable to move quickly and without food, he had come in to bite the dog and snapped at the man in passing.
The media's response to the second attack was more sensational. Major American newspapers such as the Boston Herald, Chicago Sun-Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Washington Post and San Francisco Chronicle placed the story on the front page. The New York Times' headline read, "Shark Kills Bather Off Jersey Beach". The growing panic had cost New Jersey resort owners an estimated $250,000 ($5,800,000 in 2018) in lost tourism, and sun bathing had declined by 75 percent in some areas. A press conference was convened on July 8, 1916, at the American Museum of Natural History with scientists Frederic Augustus Lucas, John Treadwell Nichols, and Robert Cushman Murphy as panelists. To calm the growing panic, the three men stressed that a third run in with a shark was unlikely, although they were admittedly surprised that sharks bit anyone at all. Nevertheless, Nichols—the only ichthyologist in the trio—warned swimmers to stay close to shore and to take advantage of the netted bathing areas installed at public beaches after the first attack. 
Question: What are the full names of the three men who were admittedly surprised that sharks bit anyone at all?

Input: Passage: In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, "He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart." When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's "I'm Eighteen" on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon.Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together:
Early Seventies Britain was a very depressing place. It was completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from the wrong side of the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us.
Their first gig was arranged by Matlock, who was studying at Saint Martins College. The band played at the school on 6 November 1975, in support of a pub rock group called Bazooka Joe, arranging to use their amps and drums. The Sex Pistols performed several cover songs, including the Who's "Substitute", the Small Faces' "Whatcha Gonna Do About It", and "(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone", made famous by the Monkees; according to observers, they were unexceptional musically aside from being extremely loud. Before the Pistols could play the few original songs they had written to date, Bazooka Joe pulled the plugs as they saw their gear being trashed. A brief physical altercation between members of the two bands took place on stage.

When she starts receiving notes from an anonymous admirer, she suspects her favorite student Sandy is responsible, and tells him they could never be lovers. The notes grow more violent and when, in her latest letter, she is invited to meet at the school's lockers at night, Lois decides to visit, hoping to stop the young man. There, she is attacked by an initial shadowy figure, whom she later identifies as Leonard Bennett, the high school's star football player.
She successfully gets away, though drops her purse, and is aided by Lieutenant Harry Graham. Graham advises her to press charges, but Lois wants to drop the matter in hopes of it blowing over.
Back at home, she notices her purse on her table, and aware that the thief is in her home, orders him to leave. As he bashes through the door to get away, Lois is now certain that Leonard is her attacker.
Leonard is able to get home without his dominant and overbearing father noticing he is gone. Mr. Bennett lectures his son on the dangers of women, stimulated by the occurrence of him being left by his wife and Leonard's mother when he was very ill.
The following day, Lois reports the incident to the principal Pendleton, but when Leonard denies the whole matter, Pendleton protects the school's most valuable athletic asset by suggesting to Lois that she should provide evidence.
Soon the story spreads around school, and with gossip surrounding Lois allegedly pursuing Leonard, both her personal and professional life becomes a mess. One day, she pulls him out of class and tries to reason with him, but he refuses to listen to her. Meanwhile, she grows closer to Graham, who does not understand why she is sympathetic to Leonard.

Input: Passage: The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.

Input: Passage: Ricketts Glen State Park is in five townships in three counties. After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber. One squatter, Jesse Dodson, cut trees from around 1830 to 1860 and built a mill and the dam for what became Lake Rose in 1842. Dodson also built a dam south of Mud Pond, near what became Lake Jean; both dams were on the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek, and each was used to make a "log splash pond". The other squatter, named Sickler, also built a mill and log dam, at what became Lake Leigh on the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. Sickler was active from 1838 to about 1860.In 1865, a well was drilled at the Dodson mill site, after a Mr. Hadley fraudulently added oil to springs in what became the park. Hadley, who had hoped that investors would think petroleum was present, got the Wheeler & Wilson sewing machine company to invest $40,000 ($650,000 in 2019) in his scheme. In the next two years they drilled two wells, one 2,100 feet (640 m) deep at the former Dodson sawmill at Lake Rose and the other 1,900 feet (580 m) deep near the Ricketts mansion. No oil was ever found, and Hadley eventually fled to Canada.

Input: Passage: On 21 January 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twenty-five-year-old daughter of a dyer from Dresden. The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820.  Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on Rügen—painted after his honeymoon—display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that "the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art."Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friend's paintings "please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind."Friedrich was acquainted with Philipp Otto Runge, another leading German painter of the Romantic period. He was also a friend of Georg Friedrich Kersting, and painted him at work in his unadorned studio, and of the Norwegian painter Johan Christian Clausen Dahl (1788–1857). Dahl was close to Friedrich during the artist's final years, and he expressed dismay that to the art-buying public, Friedrich's pictures were only "curiosities". While the poet Zhukovsky appreciated Friedrich's psychological themes, Dahl praised the descriptive quality of Friedrich's landscapes, commenting that "artists and connoisseurs saw in Friedrich's art only a kind of mystic, because they themselves were only looking out for the mystic... They did not see Friedrich's faithful and conscientious study of nature in everything he represented".During this period Friedrich frequently sketched memorial monuments and sculptures for mausoleums, reflecting his obsession with death and the afterlife; he even created designs for some of the funerary art in Dresden's cemeteries. Some of these works were lost in the fire that destroyed Munich's Glass Palace (1931) and later in the 1945 bombing of Dresden.

Input: Passage: Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky attended classes in music theory organized by the Russian Musical Society and taught by Nikolai Zaremba. A year later he followed Zaremba to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Tchaikovsky would not give up his Ministry post "until I am quite certain that I am destined to be a musician rather than a civil servant." From 1862 to 1865 he studied harmony, counterpoint and fugue with Zaremba, while Rubinstein taught him instrumentation and composition. In 1863 he abandoned his civil service career and studied music full-time, graduating in December 1865.

Input: Passage: Terri Griffith is an aspiring teenage journalist in Phoenix who feels that her teachers don't take her articles seriously because of her good looks. After failing to get her dream job as a newspaper intern, she comes to the conclusion that it is because she is a girl.
With her parents out of town on a two-week Caribbean vacation, Terri decides to remedy the situation. Enrolling at a rival high school, she enlists the help of her little brother, Buddy, and her best friend Denise to disguise herself as a boy. Along the way she meets Rick Morehouse, a nerd who becomes her pet project. After helping him through an image makeover and encouraging him to start talking to girls, Terri starts to fall for him.
After many episodes in and out of school, including fending off a group of bullies led by bodybuilder Greg Tolan, dealing with her real college boyfriend Kevin and being set up on a blind date with a potential new girlfriend named Sandy, Terri manages to be accepted as "one of the guys". However, she is stunned when she turns in an article and her teacher still criticizes her work, making Terri realize her gender and looks were never the issue.
At the senior prom, a jealous Greg picks a fight with Rick, who ultimately trounces the bully in front of the entire class. When Terri's boyfriend shows up unexpectedly and discovers the ruse, Rick assumes that Terri's big secret was that she was gay. To prove otherwise, Terri opens her shirt and reveals her breasts to Rick. Although she admits to loving him, Rick rejects her, prompting a desperate Terri to kiss him in front of everyone. To placate the awestruck students, Rick derisively announces that Terri "has tits" before leaving the prom and Terri behind.
Heartbroken and humiliated, Terri retreats to her room and writes a long article on what it is like to be a girl in boy's clothing, detailing all of her experiences, both good and bad. 
Question: What is the first name of the person that the nerd trounces in front of the entire class?
Response list: ['Rick.']
Ground truth: Greg.

Input: Passage: Jess Wade, a former member of a gang of outlaws led by Vince Hackett, was led to believe that an old flame, Tracy Winters, wanted to meet him in a seedy Mexican saloon.  Jess saw Billy Roy Hackett, Vince's younger brother, summoning Vince and the other members of the gang into the saloon, and realized he was being set up.  Jess ordered the bar patrons to leave before a shootout ensued.  Making a break for the door, Jess was stopped by Gunner, another gang member, and was forced to relinquish his gun and to go with them to their hideout in the mountains.  Vince later told him that the gang had stolen a gold-plated cannon that was used by Emperor Maximilian in his ill-fated fight against popular Mexican leader Benito Juarez.  Vince informed him that, according to a wanted poster, Jess was in the gang who stole the cannon and had sustained a neck wound as a result of being shot by one of the guards.
Ordering his men to subdue Jess on the ground, Vince used a branding iron to burn his neck.  They took his horse, leaving him stranded.  He captured a wild horse in the desert and saddle-broke it.  The gang's motive was to force a ransom from the town they stole the cannon from, but the gang also used the cannon to hold the townspeople at bay.  Only Wade can save the people from his former gang. 
Question: What is the full name of the person who did not go to the saloon?

Input: Passage: Darren Silverman, Wayne LeFessier, and J.D. McNugent, best friends since fifth grade and Neil Diamond fans throughout, form a Neil Diamond tribute band called "Diamonds in the Rough". Darren meets a beautiful but domineering psychologist who is showing signs of being emotionally abusive, Judith Fessbeggler, through a chance encounter in a local bar after a band gig. Six weeks into their relationship, Darren asks Judith if whether they could finally have sex, but Judith refuses in the belief that premarital sex is wrong; rather, she suggests non-penetrative sex as alternative, during which Darren gets nothing but a sore jaw.
Judith isolates Darren from his friends, demands that Darren quit the band, receive humiliating medical procedures, and attend relationship counseling under her care. Wayne and J.D. decide to save Darren from her by attempting to bribe her, arm wrestle her, and shock her with faked photographs of Darren cheating, all to no avail.
The friends, undaunted, try to reunite Darren with his "one and only", Sandy Perkus, when she returns to Seattle to take her final vows as a nun. When Darren and Judith announce their engagement, Wayne and J.D. kidnap Judith. However, Judith eventually discovers the identity of her captors, and the duo are convinced they cannot let her go. When they visit Coach Norton in jail (who accidentally killed a referee in a fit of rage) his advice is that they should just kill her. The pair attempt to shoot Judith, but end up deciding against it. Sandy's feelings for Darren are reawakened, but the pair's attempted date is ruined by Darren's preoccupation with Judith. Sandy, disheartened, returns to the convent, but Darren snaps out of it and runs the 30 miles there to win her back. 
Question: What are the first names of the people who visit someone in jail?
Response list: ['Neil.']
Ground truth: Wayne and J.D.

Input: Passage: The film begins with Thomas "Boats" Gilhooley ("boats" is a nickname for a bosun's mate) (Lee Marvin), an expatriate United States Navy veteran, working aboard a freighter. When he realizes that the ship is passing by Haleakaloha, French Polynesia, but not actually calling there, he jumps ship to swim to the island.
Next, Michael "Guns" Donovan ("guns" is a Navy nickname for a gunner's mate), another expatriate U.S. Navy veteran and a former shipmate of Gilhooley, returns from a fishing trip aboard an outrigger canoe. Donovan is greeted by William "Doc" Dedham, also a U.S. Navy veteran and the only physician in the archipelago, who is about to begin a one or two week pre-Christmas circuit of the "outer islands," taking care of the health needs of the residents. Dedham's three children are placed in Donovan's care.
The kids' plans for a peaceful celebration of Donovan's birthday on December 7 are shattered by the arrival of Gilhooley, who shares his birthday. There is an unbroken 21-year tradition that Donovan and Gilhooley have a knock-down, drag-out fight every birthday—-to the delight of the local observers-—and their 22nd year does not break the tradition. The two vets meet in (and trash) "Donovan's Reef," the saloon owned by Donovan.
Miss Amelia Dedham is a "proper" young lady "of means" from Boston, who has become the chairman of the board of the Dedham Shipping Company. Her father is Doc Dedham, whom she has never met, but who now has inherited a large block of stock in the family company, making him the majority stockholder. She travels to Haleakaloha in hope of finding proof that Doc has violated an outdated (but still in effect) morality clause in the will which would keep him from inheriting the stock and thus enable her to retain control. 
Question: What is the name of the person that travels from Boston to Haleakaloha?
Response list: ['Miss Amelia Dedham.']
Ground truth: Miss Amelia Dedham i.

Input: Passage: On 18 February 1914 The Rite received its first concert performance (the music without the ballet), in St Petersburg under Serge Koussevitzky. On 5 April that year, Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of The Rite as a concert work, at the Casino de Paris. After the performance, again under Monteux, the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers. The Rite had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921, at the Queen's Hall in London under Eugene Goossens. Its American premiere occurred on 3 March 1922, when  Stokowski included it in a Philadelphia Orchestra programme. Goossens was also responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946 at the Sydney Town Hall, as guest conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he brought it to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that "thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras ... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as "the most important piece of music of the 20th century".In 1963, 50 years after the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, a close friend of the composer, Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being "murdered by that frightful butcher". Instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening's performance of Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro, at Covent Garden. Under pressure from his friends, Stravinsky was persuaded to leave the opera after the first act. He arrived at the Albert Hall just as the performance of The Rite was ending; composer and conductor shared a warm embrace in front of the unaware, wildly cheering audience. Monteux's biographer John Canarina provides a different slant on this occasion, recording that by the end of the evening Stravinsky had asserted that "Monteux, almost alone among conductors, never cheapened Rite or looked for his own glory in it, and he continued to play it all his life with the greatest fidelity". 
Question: What is the last name of the person Stravinsky called a frightful butcher?
Response list: ['Monteux.']
Ground truth: Monteux.

Input: Passage: Critical analysis of Beiderbecke's work during his lifetime was sparse. Surprisingly, his innovative playing initially received greater attention and appreciation among European critics than those in the country of his birth. The British music trade magazine "Melody Maker" published a number of reviews of his recordings and assessments of his cornet playing. In the April 1927 issue, bandleader Fred Elizalde stated: "Bix Bidlebeck (sic) is considered by Red Nichols himself and every other trumpet player in the States, for that matter, as the greatest trumpet player of all time". The magazine's editor, Edgar Jackson, was equally fulsome in his praise: "Bix has a heart as big as your head, which shines through his playing with the warmth of the sun's rays" (September 1927 issue); "The next sixteen bars are a trumpet solo by Bix, and if this doesn't get you right in the heart, you'd better see a vet…."
In Blackboard Jungle, a 1955 film starring Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Beiderbecke's music is briefly featured, but as a symbol of cultural conservatism in a nation on the cusp of the rock and roll revolution.
Brendan Wolfe, the author of Finding Bix, spoke of Beiderbecke's lasting influence on Davenport, Iowa: "His name and face are still a huge part of the city's identity. There's an annual Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival, and a Bix 7 road race with tens of thousands of runners, Bix T-shirts, bumper stickers, bobble-head dolls, the whole works." In 1971, on the 40th anniversary of Beiderbecke's death, the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival was founded in Davenport, Iowa, to honor the musician.  In 1974, Sudhalter and Evans published their biography, Bix: Man and Legend, which was nominated for a National Book Award. In 1977, the Beiderbecke childhood home at 1934 Grand Avenue in Davenport was added to the National Register of Historic Places."Bix: 'Ain't None of Them Play Like Him Yet", a 1981 film documentary on Beiderbecke's life directed and produced by Brigitte Berman, featured interviews with Hoagy Carmichael, Bill Challis and others, who knew and worked with Bix. 
Question: What is the full name of the person that is considered as the greatest trumpet player of all time?
Response list: ['Bix Bidlebeck.']
Ground truth: Bix Beiderbecke.

Input: Passage: Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.
By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her "one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor.
Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as "a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea. When the painting was put up for sale in 2012, the auction house catalogue stated that it had been owned by William Ride, former director of the Western Australian Museum. It reported:The current owners assert that Professor Ride always understood the figures in the picture were Sir John Winthrop Hackett, (then owner of The West Australian newspaper, well known business man and philanthropist, whose gift allowed the construction of the impressive University of Western Australia buildings and St. George's Residential College) and his new wife, Deborah Vernon Hackett".

Input: Passage: In the opening scene, San Francisco socialite Joyce Ramsey expresses concern about the working-class background of her daughter Martha's boyfriend Phil, and her husband David, tired of his opportunistic wife's social ambitions, asks her for a divorce and moves out, prompting her to look back on their marriage.
Via a flashback, we learn about the couple's humble beginnings and discover how they worked their way into the world of the nouveau riche. David is a Santa Rosa attorney with no clients, working on construction jobs with his law partner Robert Townsend to support his bride, who serves as the struggling firm's secretary. Finding herself pregnant, Joyce schemes to land Swanson, a former factory worker with a valuable steel-making patent, as a client. She succeeds at getting him to hire David alone, and when her plot eventually is discovered, Robert quits. David is furious with his wife, but she placates him by convincing him her sole intent was to help him and their unborn child.
Back in the present, Joyce is forced to admit to her daughters their father has left her when a society columnist questions his move. She learns from a friend David has been seen with another woman and hires a private detective to investigate.
Another flashback, and David, now an executive in Swanson's company, announces he has been transferred to San Francisco but wants to live in the suburbs. Joyce, longing for the excitement of city living, changes his mind. Eventually she meets Emily Hedges, and the two, bonded by their social-climbing aspirations, become close friends. An additional flashback which occurs in the not-so-distant past reveals Robert Townsend, in desperate need of $15,000, arrives at the Ramsey home to request a loan, and Joyce tells him David is away on business and she is unable to help him. Her husband learns of her lie and comes to his former partner's aid, accusing Joyce of being callous.

Input: Passage: A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film.
Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies.
The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting "the factory" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket. 
Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good. Thus Mr Martin wins his battle of the sexes. 
Question: What is the road named where Martin's firm is located?

Input: Passage: In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be "seriously jeopardized financially" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony "rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not wished to go on the tour because flying hurt his ears, and long land journeys hurt his back. The Soviet authorities threatened to cancel the tour if he did not lead it, and he felt obliged to go. The LPO gave nine concerts in Moscow and four in Leningrad.  Boult's assistant conductors were Anatole Fistoulari and George Hurst. Boult's four Moscow programmes included Vaughan Williams's Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, Holst's The Planets, Walton's Violin Concerto (with Alfredo Campoli as soloist), and Schubert's Great C major Symphony. While in Moscow, Boult and his wife visited the Bolshoi Opera and were guests at the composer Dmitri Shostakovich's 50th birthday party.After the Russian tour, Boult told the LPO that he wished to step down from the principal conductorship. He continued to be the orchestra's main conductor until his successor William Steinberg took up the post in 1959.  After the sudden resignation of Andrzej Panufnik from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO), Boult returned as principal conductor of the CBSO for the 1959–60 season. That was his last chief conductorship, though he remained closely associated with the LPO as its president and a guest conductor until his retirement. 
Question: What is the name of the orchestra to whose funds Bould always contributed his share of the recording fees?

Ground truth: LPO.

Input: Passage: With lessons learned from the Sanderson series, Longacre proposed to issue his own set of biographies illustrated with plates of the subjects.  He was on the point of launching this project, having invested $1,000 of his own money (equal to $25,097 today) in preparation, when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series.  In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery (later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who traveled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life.  He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president James Madison, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits.  Among these advocates was the former vice president, South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In July 1832, Niles' Register described a Longacre engraving, "one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art".Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827; between 1828, when their daughter Sarah was born, and 1840, they had three boys and two girls.  Sales of the Gallery lagged due to the Panic of 1837; Longacre was forced to declare bankruptcy and travel through the southern and midwestern states, peddling his books from town to town, with his wife and elder daughter managing shipping and finances at home.  Later in 1837, he was able to return to Philadelphia and open a banknote engraving firm with partners, Toppan, Draper, Longacre & Co.  With great demand for engraving for notes being issued by state banks, the firm prospered, and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at 1 Wall Street in New York.  According to Snow, Longacre was known as the best engraver in the country. 
Question: Was is the first name of the person Longacre wrote to in October 1831?
Response list: ['James Herring.']
Ground truth: James.

Instruction: In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.
Input: His "something for everyone" programme includes a musical version of Groundhog Day, an adaptation of Dr Seuss's The Lorax, Ibsen's The Master Builder starring Ralph Fiennes, and Pinter's The Caretaker with Timothy Spall.
The director of hit musical Matilda and acclaimed film Pride tells the BBC of his hopes for his first year in the job and what it's like taking over from Kevin Spacey.
What's the past year been like since you were announced as the Old Vic's new boss?
Having got the job and being told that it was going to start in summer 2015, within hours somebody from the Old Vic called me and said we need you to announce your first season in the new year.
Then we got into a discussion about that season being a whole year of work. Obviously, I wasn't walking round with a year's season in my head, so I had to scramble to do a lot of things very quickly.
It's been incredibly busy while tending to Matilda in the background and releasing Pride in the autumn as well, so it was full of exciting, breathtakingly hopeful moments and crushing disappointments when projects fell to pieces.
Your new season starts with a new play, Future Conditional by Tamsin Oglesby. How important is it to bring in new work?
It's a very important thing. The thing about choosing the first play is that it's ridiculously symbolic. I've had this play for a while. It's got so many people in it, it's been hard to find somewhere to do it.
It's political, funny and thought-provoking and has a big, strong youth aspect. It reflects so many of the things I care about.
What does it mean to you to be able to premiere Groundhog Day at the Old Vic?
I was developing it beforehand. We didn't know where it was going to go. I thought that what we were really making was an intelligent, mainstream Broadway musical, with a lot in common with The Music Man and Our Town as American fables.
It needs a large audience and a large stage, and I wanted to start it in this country, so it's the perfect match.
Do you feel extra pressure after your success with Matilda?
Making a new musical is a mountain to climb, and each time you say "That's the last one, I'm not going to do it anymore." They are hard enough to do without added expectations.
They're so hard that actually a lot of the time, you don't think about the audiences or critics. You think of something much more immediate, problems like the scene or the set.
You can't predict how much people will like it, but what we can do is make the story have integrity. It's absolutely possible it could be a flop.
If you're worried about whether something succeed or fails, then don't even start on it. You have to have a bigger reason for doing it.
What's your thinking behind your Â£10 preview ticket scheme?
What I'm interested in is removing the obstacle of affordability for people who think they might be inclined to try out theatre.
I'm not somebody who says that everybody has to love theatre, any more than everybody has to love football, but some people could form a really meaningful relationship with theatre and haven't because of the ticket price.
We've got to remove that. We've got make the experience feel less posh.
How do you think your approach will differ from Kevin Spacey's?
It will differ enormously in some respects and not at all in others. While he's been head of the building he's had an enormous number of people helping him, and those people are still here. So how the theatre functions is unchanged on many levels.
I'll be pretty much invisible. I'm a director - I like hiding behind other people.
But there will be glamour as well, because there will be a lot of star actors passing though the theatre.
[Kevin] could shake somebody's hand and get them to write a cheque. I can't do that, but they'll write a cheque for my ideas that I'm pitching or because Ralph Fiennes or Tim Spall is standing next to me.
It's funny because people used to to say: "How can a Hollywood actor run a theatre?" Last night people were asking if I was nervous about taking over from Kevin. It's like only Hollywood actors can run a theatre now!
The Old Vic's new season begins on 1 September.

Instruction: In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.
Input: Sydney-based Michael Robotham won the British Gold Dagger award for his novel Life or Death.
Former journalist Mr Robotham defeated prominent writers including JK Rowling - writing as Robert Galbraith - and Stephen King for the honour.
Life or Death, his 10th novel, is the story of a prisoner who escapes shortly before he is due to be released.
Mr Robotham, who lives in Sydney, said he was grateful for the respect of his fellow writers.
"For all the fact that it's lovely to have commercial success, to sell lots of books, to be able to be a full-time writer, something like the Dagger makes you feel you have the respect of your peers and you are part of a long tradition of very fine writers," he said.
Mr Robotham said that many of the autobiographies he ghost-wrote while in Britain of "the great, the good and the less good" assisted him in his novel writing.
"I was very comfortable capturing the voice and making the characters live and breathe on the page and making them seem very real because I had written for so many real people over that 10-year period," he was quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald as saying.
One of his subjects was the imprisoned performer Rolf Harris who was jailed last year for 12 indecent assaults on four girls, one aged just seven or eight.
Mr Robotham said that he felt betrayed by Harris and "beat himself up enormously" about it.
He has become the second Australian to win a Gold Dagger, after Peter Temple for The Broken Shore in 2007.
Response list: ['Australian writer Michael Robotham has won the British Gold Dagger award for his novel Life or Death.']

Input: Mr Obama said after the meeting that much of the discussion had focused on the upcoming climate conference in Paris.
Mr Modi added that the two sides had set "ambitious national agendas" to tackle climate change.
Experts say India's position is key if a climate change deal is to be signed in Paris later this year.
India is the world's third largest carbon emitter, after China and the US.
This is the fifth meeting between Mr Obama and Mr Modi since the latter swept to power in India in May 2014.
"What I indicated to the prime minister is that I really think that India's leadership in this upcoming conference will set the tone not just for today but for decades to come", Mr Obama said in a statement after the meeting.
Mr Modi's statement said that while both leaders shared "an uncompromising commitment on climate change", he was careful to mention that this was "without affecting our ability to meet the development aspirations of humanity".
India argues that more than 20% of its population has no access to electricity and they have a right to development.
Earlier this year, India's Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar told the BBC that India would not follow China's lead to announce a target year for its carbon emissions to peak.
However, Mr Modi reiterated his commitment to "clean and sustainable energy" and announced plans to include "not just a plan to add 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022, but a development strategy that will enable us to transition to a more sustainable energy mix".
The statement from the Indian side added that Mr Modi had sought US help to bring about "UN reform" under which India is seeking a permanent seat on the security council.

Input: The Scot triumphed at the WGC-HSBC Champions tournament in 2015 then won at the Travelers Championship in 2016.
But the world number 44 has not registered a top-10 finish in 2017.
"Maybe after last year being so incredible for me, it was inevitable there was going to be a slight downturn," Knox told BBC Scotland.
"I haven't played as well, but I don't feel any different, to be honest. I don't feel my game has dropped any.
"Golf's a funny old game as everybody knows; the line is so small between playing well and not playing well. Right now I'm just not getting the most out of my rounds.
"I'm hitting the ball well, I've maybe just got to take care of a few more putts and avoid the silly mistakes that creep in. I'm very optimistic that things are going to turn around very soon."
The 32-year-old is in Paris to compete in the European Tour's French Open at Le Golf National, which is also the venue for the 2018 Ryder Cup.
Inverness-born Knox narrowly missed out on selection for Team Europe in 2016 and is determined to do what it takes to be one of Thomas Bjorn's picks next year.
"It's exciting to come to Europe for a month," said Knox, who is normally based in Florida.
"I won't be playing the Irish Open because we're going to spend a week in Italy on holiday to keep my wife happy. I'm very much looking forward to this week and then the Scottish Open and the Open Championship. It would be great to peak for those events.
"It's obviously my goal to make the Ryder Cup team, and with Le Golf National being the venue for it, I thought it would be great to come and give it a go - the course looks really good.
"Just standing around at the 18th, it's a nice little area where you can see a bunch of holes and I can just imagine how good the atmosphere will be come Ryder Cup time because there will be so many people around those holes.
"They have a lot of water around them so there's going to be a lot of risk-reward, so I think it's going to be a fantastic venue."
Response list: ['Scott Knox has not played well in 2017, but is still determined to be one of the top picks for the Ryder Cup.']
Ground truth: Russell Knox believes playing in Europe over the next month can help him rediscover the form that won him two titles in a year.

The number of international travellers rose by 13.6% in February, with Edinburgh now officially the UK's fastest-growing airport in terms of international passengers.
The airport said the benefits of its growth would extend outwith the hub.
Edinburgh Airport chief executive Gordon Dewar said: "Once again our passenger numbers have broken a new record.
"This is further proof that the airport is continuing to service the growing demand for what is without doubt one of Europe's leading cities.
"As we grow we deliver greater international connectivity for this city and for Scotland - and the benefits of our growth are felt well beyond this airport."

Input: Campaign groups have condemned the election of the countries to the 47-seat Human Rights Council.
Human Rights Watch said some new members had denied access to UN monitors investigating alleged abuses.
The UN General Assembly elected a total of 14 new members to the Geneva-based council on Tuesday.
China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Algeria and Cuba won seats unopposed, but human rights groups have complained that they are the countries that the body should be censuring.
New York-based Human Rights Watch singled out five countries - China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Algeria - which have denied access to UN human rights monitors keen to investigate alleged abuses.
"Countries that haven't allowed UN experts appointed by the council to visit have a lot of explaining to do," said Peggy Hicks, the group's global advocacy director.
And UN Watch, a frequent critic of UN practices, also accused these countries, along with Algeria, of systematically violating the rights of their citizens.
The newly members will be on the council for three years from 2014. The body aims to shine a spotlight on rights abuses by adopting resolutions.
UN Watch made a broader criticism of the Human Rights Council, accusing it of repeatedly criticising Israel while failing to adopt a resolution that has been critical of China, Russia or Saudi Arabia.
The Human Rights Council was created in 2006 to replace the UN's widely discredited Human Rights Commission.
But the council has faced similar criticism to the commission, with the election of countries with questionable track records in human rights.
South Sudan and Uruguay failed to win seats in the competitive elections for their regional grouping on Tuesday. The other regions had uncontested votes.
Response list: ['The UN has elected 14 new members to the Human Rights Council, a body that has been accused of failing to hold Israel accountable for human rights abuses.']
Ground truth: China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Vietnam have been elected to the UN's human rights watchdog, despite concerns about their rights records.

Perry, in his first Triple Crown final at the age of 42, led 4-1 but missed a straightforward red for a 5-1 lead.
O'Sullivan won seven frames in a row to move 8-4 ahead before Perry, helped by breaks of 117 and 92, fought back.
But O'Sullivan, 41, sealed victory to defend his title and move ahead of Stephen Hendry's six Masters wins.
Victory means O'Sullivan claimed the newly named Paul Hunter trophy - in honour of the three-time champion who died of cancer aged 27 in 2006 - as well as the £200,000 winners' prize money.
It also ensured the world number 13 ended a run of three defeats in finals this season and defended the title he won last year by thrashing Barry Hawkins 10-1.
"Joe played a brilliant tournament, a really good match and he should've beaten me. I got lucky - I stole it," said O'Sullivan.
"Joe will come again and he is a tough competitor. I'm just relieved to have got over the line. The fans have been unbelievable and I really enjoyed this week."
On winning seven Masters title, O'Sullivan added: "It is great to get some records, I still have the World Championship one to get.
"When I was younger I was just happy to win one, so to win seven, someone up there is looking after me."
'The Rocket' had to deal with a virus in his first-round final-frame victory over Liang Wenbo and needed to repair a broken cue tip in the semi-final against Marco Fu, which he said was the "best match he has ever won".
In the final, O'Sullivan seemed unsettled by noise coming from a backstage table early on, but pulled himself together to level the match 4-4 at the interval.
He claimed a 32-minute ninth frame to move into the lead for the first time, and then knocked in breaks of 85 and 68 to take control.
At 8-6 and with Perry fighting back, O'Sullivan made his first century of the match - a break of 112 - and 859th of his career.
The Englishman then held his nerve to win a 20-minute tactical frame and claim his 17th Triple Crown title.
Along with seven Masters - the first of which he won in 1995 - he has also claimed five World and five UK Championship crowns, and is now just one behind Hendry's record of 18.

Perry has only won one ranking title - the 2015 Players Championship - but seemed to take to the occasion well, with breaks of 72, 74 and 115 giving him a surprise lead.
But rattling the final red in the jaws of the pocket when presented with the opportunity to go 5-1 up seemed to dent his confidence.
Fair play to Ronnie, even when he is not at his best he is still amazing
Although he rallied by clawing back three frames late on, O'Sullivan's substantial advantage was too great to overturn.
"I've proved a lot, that there is still some life left in me and it has given me the belief to go on and win a big one," said Perry.
"At 4-1 up I got a bit carried away and it was not until I was 8-4 down I thought, 'I'm going for it'.
"It's given me the taste to go for more finals, it's a great feeling to be involved and you take snooker up for nights like this.
"Fair play to Ronnie, even when he is not at his best he is still amazing."

Input: General Ali Fadavi accused those detained of "unprofessional" acts.
But he suggested the group, who are being held by the guards, could be released soon.
The incident comes at a sensitive time, as the US and Iran try to implement the deal on Iran's nuclear activities.
US Secretary of State John Kerry has contacted Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif over the incident.
Giving his assessment of the talks, Gen Fadavi said "Mr Zarif had a firm stance, saying that they were in our territorial waters and should not have been, and saying that they [the US] should apologise".
"This has been done and it will not take long, and the naval force, according to its hierarchy, will act immediately upon the orders it receives," he added.
This naval incident comes at a delicate moment for both Washington and Tehran.
The process to begin lifting the sanctions imposed on Iran due to its nuclear activities is expected to get under way at the end of this week.
There are many conservatives and hardliners in both countries who would dearly love to sabotage the deal and consequently both governments may be eager - whatever the attendant rhetoric -  to get this episode resolved as quickly as possible.
How it plays out will be an important signal as to the balance of power in Tehran itself.
The Revolutionary Guard Corps, whose naval branch detained the US vessels and their crews,  is amongst the more hardline elements ranked up against the nuclear deal.
But the potential economic benefits of lifting the sanctions may be too great an inducement for the agreement to be derailed now.
US officials have said the sailors - nine men and a woman - are likely to be released on Wednesday. There has been no confirmation from Washington that Mr Kerry apologised.
One of the two US riverine patrol boats developed mechanical problems while on a training mission between Bahrain and Kuwait, the US officials added.
The crew and vessels have been taken to Farsi Island, the site of an Iranian naval base.
Iran's influential Revolutionary Guard - tasked with protecting the country's 1979 Islamic revolution - has strongly defended Iranian sea borders in the past.
Fifteen British sailors and marines were held for 13 days in 2007 after they were captured in a disputed area between Iran and Iraq.
Despite last year's breakthrough nuclear deal tensions remain between the US and Iran.
In December, Iran's navy conducted rocket tests near US warships in the Strait of Hormuz, something the US called "highly provocative".

He is set to front a new motoring show for Amazon next year, alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond.
Clarkson's appearance on Have I Got News For You will be his first on the BBC since his departure from Top Gear.
He was suspended in March after assaulting producer Oisin Tymon, and the BBC later confirmed his contract would not be renewed.
At the time, BBC director-general Tony Hall said "a line has been crossed" and that "there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another".
Clarkson signed up to present Have I Got News For You on Friday, and his appearance will mark the start of the show's 50th series.
When he pulled out of hosting in April, production company Hat Trick had suggested the presenter would appear on the show soon.

Input: The Royal Mint has said that it saw a "surge" in demand for the precious metal following the Bank of England's cut in base rates to 0.25% on 4 August.
During that week the Mint saw a 25% increase in transactions on its bullion website.
It also experienced a 50% increase in sales of gold bars and coins, compared with the previous week.
It is thought investors are turning to gold as cash and bonds offer diminishing returns, exacerbated by lower interest rates.
So far this year, the price of gold has risen by 45% in sterling terms, and 25% in dollar terms.
"Although the stock market has been doing well of late, it didn't do so well at the start of the year, and there was a lot of volatility around the time of the referendum," said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Landown.
"That helps gold."
However he also warned that gold prices will not necessarily continue rising.
"It's worth pointing out gold is by no means a one way bet - in 2011 it was trading at above $1800 an ounce. It's an insurance policy for the rest of your investments and as such should make up no more than 5-10% of your portfolio."
Gold is currently trading at $1344 an ounce.
Earlier this week, the World Gold Council reported that global investment demand for gold hit a record level in the first six months of this year.
However consumer demand in countries such as  India and China, traditionally among the strongest buyers of gold, was lower.

Input: Aqib Mazhar, of Russell Road, was stabbed in the chest on the street where he lived on 1 June and died from a single stab wound in hospital.
His car was blocked in by three vehicles, trapping him as he came under attack, police said.
The four men, aged between 18 and 24, from Nottingham and Derby, all pleaded guilty to manslaughter.
Over weeks animosity grew between Mr Mazhar and a group of men and it culminated that evening, the court heard.
At the sentencing at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday, Judge Stuart Rafferty told the offenders Mr Mazhar's death was "wholly needless".
Mohamud Alasow, 18, of Hamilton Road, Nottingham, was jailed for 10 years and six months.
Junaid Farrukh, 21, of Heathermead Close, Oakwood, Derby; and Mohammed Qasim, 24, of Staindale Drive, Aspley; were both sentenced to nine years and 11 months in prison.
Qamran Ahmed, 21, also of Staindale Drive, received a seven-year sentence.
The men were initially on trial for murder, but the charge was changed to manslaughter during the two-week trial last week.
Mobile phone footage thought to show one of the defendants as Mr Mazhar killer was reviewed and revealed a fifth person, who is on the run, carried out the fatal stabbing.
Judge Rafferty said: "This is not a murder case, none of you stabbed Aqib... the murderer is still at large.
"The tragedy of this case is that all four of you know perfectly well who stabbed Aqib, but you have done nothing to speak out to put Aqib's family at their ease."
Det Ch Insp Rob Severn, of Nottinghamshire Police, said the investigation and the hunt for the person who fatally stabbed Mr Mazhar was continuing.

Input: The suspects fled into the bushes towards Zimbabwe after their efforts to free the car from the sand failed, local police say.
Last December a vehicle stolen in Durban was recovered on the same river, attached to a group of donkeys.
Local police are investigating whether a syndicate is behind the new practice.
Police Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo says a Mercedez Benz C220 was recovered on the river bed close to Musina.
The suspects had put metal sheets under the wheels to make it easier to pull across the sand.
"The suspects were using donkeys to pull the car across the riverâ€š but our members were just in time to pounce on them after the donkeys were apparently no longer able to pull it through the sand," Mr Mojapelo is quoted in local media as saying.
The donkeys were unharmed.
It is not clear why the thieves do not simply driver the car into Zimbabwe but one reason might be that most modern cars are fitted with a tracking device which uses satellite tracking to locate a vehicle, if stolen.
The tracker is only active when the car is running.
The Limpopo River forms the border between South Africa and Zimbabwe and is a well known transit point for illegal immigrants moving between both countries but the news of it becoming a smuggling point for cars is a surprise development, says the BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg.
Authorities regularly patrol the Beit-Bridge border post to monitor movements between the two countries in a bid to curb cross-border crime, our correspondent says.

But she woke up, apparently without her captors realising, to hear one of them whispering to her that she was "going to do God's work".
The kidnappers told her she was being taken to the city of Kano to attack the Kantin Kwari textile market.
But when the car engine overheated, both kidnappers were distracted - one was examining the engine while the other went to look for water.
Ms Ibrahim then managed to flee and a man in the Hotoro neighbourhood of Kano took her to the police.
She was also brought before the Kano state governor, Umar Ganduje, who told the media: "If this woman had not regained consciousness the story would have been  different by now."
The woman is now in "safe custody....undergoing post-traumatic rehabilitation," Kano police spokesman Magaji Musa Majiya told the BBC's Hausa service.
Police are trying to track down the vehicle in an attempt to find a second kidnapped girl, thought to be about 15 years old, he added.
The other woman in the car with her may also have been drugged, Ms Ibrahim suggested.
Boko Haram has staged numerous attacks using young women in the past year.

Input: Public Health England (PHE) wants widespread vaccination to stop flu spreading to "at risk" people.
These include pregnant women, young children, over 65s and those with conditions such as asthma and diabetes.
Last winter 904 people were admitted to intensive care with flu and 98 of them died.
Children up to the age of three were eligible for free vaccination last year, and four-year-olds have now been included.
For those aged two, three and four, this is given as a nasal spray rather than an injection.
Flu viruses constantly mutate so a new vaccine is devised each year and annual jabs are needed to stay protected.
Flu has been comparatively mild in recent years, and health officials are concerned this could lead to complacency.
Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said: "Flu is a really unpleasant illness, particularly for our most vulnerable patients, and it is essential that people take steps to protect themselves during the winter months.
"I would urge those who are offered the free flu vaccination to visit their GP early in the flu season.
"I also urge all health care workers to make they are vaccinated to protect themselves, their patients and their families".
Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at PHE, said about 40% of pregnant women were vaccinated last year - a figure he hoped would be higher this year.
"Women can safely have the vaccine at any point during pregnancy and it can reduce the risk of complications such as pneumonia and premature birth, that can arise as a result of flu," he said.
The government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has advised offering free flu jabs to all two to 17-year-olds.
PHE is in the process of extending the coverage.
Similar vaccination schemes operate in Scotland, where two million people are to be offered free vaccination this year, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Response list: ['The government has extended the free flu vaccination programme to include children aged two to four.']
Ground truth: Four-year-olds in England are to be offered free flu vaccinations for the first time as part of the annual drive to get people protected before winter.

Input: The London Somalia Conference, co-chaired by the UK, Somalia and the United Nations, will be held in Lancaster House, a grand mansion in the exclusive district of St James's. Many of the delegates will stay in swish hotels nearby.
This is the third such London gathering since 2012, and there is an element of "cut and paste" to its agenda, which focuses on security, governance and the economy.
The official conference document emphasises how much progress has been made.
But its description of Somalia from the time of the first meeting still applies: "Chronically unstable and ungoverned", and threatened by Islamist militants, piracy and famine.
There has been some improvement.
Piracy, which at its height cost $7bn (Â£5.4bn) a year, is much diminished, although there has been a recent resurgence.
US drones, African Union troops, Western "security advisers" and Somali forces have pushed al-Shabab from most major towns, although the jihadists still control many areas and attack at will.
A recent electoral process resulted in a new and - for the time being - popular president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, nicknamed Farmajo, and more female and youth representation in parliament.
Somalia is in a "pre-famine" stage rather than the full-blown disaster of 2011, in which more than 250,000 people died.
But it is perhaps surprising that the current water shortage will not be a headline topic at the conference.
The country is in the grip of its worst drought in decades. Four successive rainy seasons have failed.
Even before you enter Burao Regional Hospital, in the self-declared Republic of Somaliland's drought-stricken Togdheer region, you hear the haunting, high-pitched wailing of malnourished children.
One boy, dressed in purple, stares blankly at the wall. "His brain is damaged due to a prolonged lack of adequate nutrition," says Dr Yusuf Ali, who returned home to Somalia from the UK two years ago. "He will never recover."
According to Unicef, the number of children who are or will be acutely malnourished in 2017 is up by 50% from the beginning of the year, to a total of 1.4 million, including 275,000 for whom the condition is or will be life-threatening.
Most are too sick to go to school or help herd animals, making the life of the country's many nomads even more precarious.
People are already dying from hunger and diseases that strike those weakened by lack of food.
Severely malnourished children are nine times more likely than healthy ones to die from illnesses such as measles and diarrhoea.
The World Health Organization says there were more than 25,000 cases of cholera in the first four months of 2017, with the number expected to more than double to 54,000 by June.
More than 500 people have already died from the disease.
It is not just humans who are suffering.
In Somaliland, officials say, 80% of livestock have died.
Livestock is the mainstay of the economy - the ports in Somaliland and nearby Djibouti export more live animals than anywhere else in the world, mainly to the Gulf.
In south-western Somalia, tens of thousands of drought-affected people have fled to Baidoa, clustering into flimsy, makeshift shelters on the outskirts of the city.
This area - known as the "triangle of death" - was the epicentre of the famines of 2011 and 1991.
"Al-Shabab is harvesting the boys and men we left behind on our parched land, offering them a few dollars and a meal," says one woman. "Against their will, our children and husbands have become the jihadists' new army."
"The biggest problem in dealing with this drought is insecurity," says Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden, president of South West State, in his modest palace in Baidoa.
The city, which is protected by a ring of Ethiopian troops, is right in the heart of al-Shabab country. "The militants have closed all the roads so we cannot deliver help to those who need it most."
This brings home in the starkest of terms why security is top of the London Somalia Conference agenda.
As long as Somalia remains violent, with different parts of the country controlled by a multitude of often conflicting armed groups, it will be impossible to deliver emergency assistance, let alone long-term development.
The recently created South West State is one of the regions making up the new federal Somalia.
Critics fear this will lead to balkanisation, and risks introducing another dimension to conflict, as the new states rub up against each other and start fighting. This has already happened in central Somalia, where last year there were deadly clashes between Puntland and Galmudug states.
The attitude of people in South West State shows how much of a gamble the federal system is.
"We have always been marginalised and looked down on by other Somalis," says a farmer, Fatima Issa.
"We do not want the federal troops here. They don't hunt down al-Shabab the way our local militias do. We should push for more autonomy, maybe even break away and declare independence like Somaliland did in 1991."
One aim of the London Somalia Conference is to push for more progress on the sharing of resources between the regions and the centre. This contentious issue has been debated since before the first London gathering in 2012.
South West State has a special friendship with Ethiopia, which is not on the best of terms with the new federal government. This highlights another possible problem - some foreign powers have started to sign bilateral agreements with regional states.
For instance, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is building a military base in Somaliland, a territory the federal government considers an integral part of Somalia. The UAE has also given military hardware to Jubaland State in southern Somalia.
Somalia's former special envoy to the US, Abukar Arman, has described the London Somalia Conference as a "predatory carnival", with foreign powers gathering to slice up Somalia for their own benefit.
Some in Somalia see it as a waste of time.
"It is an expensive talking-shop," says Ahmed Mohamed, a rickshaw driver in the capital Mogadishu. "The politicians and diplomats are obsessed with the conference instead of taking action on the drought."
But lessons have been learned, and there is now a far more nuanced approach to Somalia than there was when the crisis began, in the late 1980s.
The US response to the Somali famine of 1991 was to send in nearly 30,000 troops. This ended in a humiliating withdrawal, following the shooting down of two US Black Hawk helicopters in 1993.
Now, much of the talk is of "Somali-owned" processes, although the shadows of a growing number of foreign powers can be seen lurking in the background.
Response list: ['The London Somalia Conference is expected to be held in the UK in 2018, with talks on security, development and the economy.']
Ground truth: This Thursday, the great and the good will descend on London to discuss Somalia, a country that has topped the Fragile States Index for eight of the past 10 years.

Input: Ms Clwyd was speaking for the first time about the report into Owen Roberts' death at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff in 2012.
She has said her husband was treated like a "battery hen."
Cardiff and Vale University Health Board has apologised unreservedly and said the failings were "unacceptable".
The Cynon Valley MP has made a public protest about the care her late husband received while he was in hospital last year.
She said her husband was treated with coldness, indifference and even contempt by NHS staff "who didn't care".
After speaking out about her concerns, Prime Minister David Cameron asked her to review how hospitals in England deal with complaints from patients and their families.
She has now received a confidential report from the health board and spoke about her husband's care in a Commons debate on NHS complaints.
Speaking on BBC Radio Wales she said: "I did feel that it was very difficult to speak to nursing staff.
"In fact, on the night before he died I stopped a nurse in a corridor and asked why he wasn't in intensive care and she brushed me aside and said 'there are a lot worse than he is' and then walked on.
"So I didn't even have a discussion with her and, of course, the next day Owen died."
Ms Clwyd compared her husband's 27 hours on a trolley in A&E or its spill-over ward with the four-hour target introduced in England a decade ago.
She said: "If they think four hours is too long, then 27 hours definitely is.
"There is an admission that he should not have been nursed in that area for the length of time he remained there and that it fell significantly below the standard expected and this is unacceptable.
"That's just one aspect of it. There were lots of things about his care I was concerned about."
Ms Clwyd said that she had asked a GP friend to examine the report and said her conclusion was that "Owen was not properly treated or investigated".
The health board said it wanted to offer its "sincere condolences" to Ms Clwyd and her family.
It said: "Given the gravity of the concerns raised by Ms Clwyd about her husband's care, we set up an independent panel to oversee an investigation.
"The panel was made up of Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan Community Health Council, the patient watchdog, Health Inspectorate Wales and an independent member of the health board.
"The investigation was undertaken in line with the requirements of the NHS concerns process, Putting Things Right.  Every concern raised by Ms Clwyd was investigated.
"We have shared the outcome of the investigation with Ms Clwyd and have offered to meet with her to discuss the findings.
"It would not be right for us to publish what is a private report for Ms Clwyd. In view of Ms Clwyd's comments however, we would welcome Ms Clwyd releasing the report in its entirety into the public domain.
"We fully appreciate how difficult it is for anyone to raise concerns about the care of a loved one at such an emotional time and we would like to thank Ms Clwyd for her input into the investigation, which has been invaluable in helping us understand her experience."
Response list: ['A former nurse who spoke out about her late husband\'s treatment in hospital has said she was "coldly treated" by NHS staff.']
Ground truth: The late husband of Labour MP Ann Clwyd was kept on a trolley in the emergency department of Wales' largest hospital for 27 hours, she has revealed.

'Cashgate' - Malawi's murky scandal
The BBC's Raphael Tenthani in Blantyre says dozens of civil servants have been charged in the "cashgate" investigations and so far there have been at least five convictions.
The scandal has revealed several cases of money being spent without services being provided.
The two military men may be facing charges of abuse of public office, negligence by a public officer in preserving money and money laundering, a statement from the ACB says.
An investigation has found that the army paid $4.4m (Â£2.8m) for the equipment that was not supplied.
The "cashgate" issue came to light in September 2013 after the attempted assassination of the finance ministry's budget director Paul Mphwiyo.
Just days before, a junior civil servant was allegedly found with more than $300,000 in cash in the boot of his car.
More cash was confiscated from some civil servants' homes and car boots.
Malawi's donors then withheld $150m pending further investigation into the scandal.

Input: The militants attacked from four sides of the city in the middle of the night.
Mahmood Danish, spokesman for the provincial governor, said Afghan forces had repelled the attack.
Kunduz was briefly captured by the Taliban last September -  the first time the insurgents had taken a major city - but government forces, backed by Nato, recaptured it within days.
In southern Helmand province, militants have also taken a strategically important district to the south of Lashkar Gah, killing the local police chief, officials say.
A number of other police casualties were also reported.
Residents in Kunduz told the BBC they heard heavy fighting and helicopters flying over the strategically important city.
Mohammadullah Bahej, head of the police co-ordination office in Kunduz, said the militants had been pushed back but fighting was continuing on the outskirts of the city.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the Taliban had captured several checkpoints in the city.
"A massive operation started on Kunduz capital from four directions early this morning," Mr Mujahid said via his official Twitter account.
The capture of Kunduz by the Taliban last September was a huge blow to the country's Western-backed government. The militants abandoned the city after four days but they had proved their growing capability.
The group raided Tarin Kot, the provincial capital of Uruzgan, earlier this month.
Afghan government forces are estimated to have control over no more than two-thirds of Afghanistan.
The attacks come ahead of a major international donor conference in Brussels on Tuesday, where Afghanistan's international partners will discuss ongoing funding for the country.

Input: The British Retail Consortium (BRC) analysed 10 billion retail payments in 2012 - 60% of all UK retail sales.
Cash accounted for about 54% of all transactions, but non-cash, non-card payments rose from less than 2% to 5% of the total.
Debit cards also remained popular, the figures showed.
Use of cash in terms of the number of transactions and money spent in shops was down on the previous year. This was the first time in the survey's 13-year history that both measures recorded a fall.
Alternative means of payment, such as online payments and money-off coupons, grew, although these remained a fraction of the total.
"These methods will be the 'ones to watch' in the future, and retailers are investing heavily to make sure their customers have choice and convenience in ways to pay, whether in-store, at home or on the move," said Helen Dickinson, director general of the BRC.
Debit cards accounted for 30% of transactions, while credit cards or charge cards were used in nearly 11% of cases.
The BRC repeated its concern that credit card transactions cost retailers significantly more to process than cash.
Response list: ['Cash payments have fallen to 54% of all transactions in the UK, according to a new survey.']
Ground truth: Cash is still the most popular form of payment in UK shops but the popularity of vouchers and coupons is on the rise, research has suggested.

Input: Joe Smyth, who achieved UKIP's highest vote share in Wales in 2015, said Mr Gill showed "no leadership" during its turmoil over assembly poll selections.
Another three general election candidates, two standing in May's poll, have also called for Mr Gill to go.
A UKIP Wales spokesman said Mr Gill had "stood up constantly" for "proper representation" for the Welsh members.
On Tuesday, Mr Gill announced local members would now decide the rankings for UKIP's regional list candidates, seen as the party's best hopes for winning seats.
Mr Smyth, re-selected for Islwyn at May's assembly election, said Mr Gill should have insisted the Welsh party ran whole the selection process.
There were complaints within the party about the original plan for its National Executive Committee (NEC) to have the final say.
Mr Gill has described the move to give local branches a vote over the final rankings as a "great victory" over the NEC.
But some remain unhappy that former Conservative MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless are still in the running for selection.
At the general election, Mr Smyth won 19.8% of the vote in Islwyn.
Despite being re-selected for the constituency for the assembly poll, he pulled out of the regional list selection in protest at the way it was being organised.
Mr Smyth told BBC Wales both Mr Gill and the NEC had treated members, activists and candidates with "contempt".
"He's trying to make out now that he's saved the selection process by allowing the Welsh members to vote on the candidates, it's a fallacy," he said.
"Nathan was responsible and agreed to how the selection process was going to be run at the very beginning.
"It's completely and utterly farcical."
Accusing Mr Gill of "weak leadership", Mr Smyth called for him to "resign straight away".
The criticisms were endorsed by Blair Smillie, UKIP's candidate for Alyn and Deeside at the general election.
"Nathan Gill has been terrible, he has to go," he said.
"There is no leadership in Wales, the organisation in north Wales is in disarray."
Nigel Williams, standing in the Delyn constituency in May after running for UKIP in 2015, said he had been "concerned for some time we lack leadership across Wales".
"We've let the general election momentum slip, we need better leadership," he said.
Ken Beswick, UKIP's Torfaen general election candidate added: "Nathan Gill is not suitable as a leader - he has no backbone.
"He's very close to Nigel Farage and won't stand up to him."
Responding to the criticism, a UKIP spokesman said: "Far from being weak he's actually been very determined in his commitment to ensuring the process is not controlled by party elites.
"The selection process has been deeply complex to ensure the best outcome; there will always be people dissatisfied.
"We think putting the decision in the hands of the membership is the most democratic option.
"All candidates that will be submitted to the membership have been rigorously vetted to ensure the highest calibre candidates are put forward to represent UKIP Wales."
Response list: ["UKIP's candidate for the Isle of Wight assembly seat has called for the party's leader to resign."]
Ground truth: Four former UKIP general election candidates have called for the party's Welsh leader Nathan Gill to resign.

Input: However, Prime Minister Isaac Zida, who was also detained when the presidential guard stormed a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, remains under house arrest.
The African Union has suspended Burkina Faso and threatened sanctions unless the junta releases all interim political figures from detention.
The US and France have also condemned the coup in the former French colony.
The coup leaders have agreed to the "principle of dialogue", as two West African leaders arrived in the country to mediate in the crisis.
At least three people have died in protests in the capital, Ouagadougou, after an ally of ex-President Blaise Compaore was named leader on Thursday.
The influential Balai Citoyen civil society group has put the number of people who have died in demonstrations against the presidential guard (RSP) , at 10.
An unknown number of protesters have also been detained.
The BBC's Laeila Adjovi in Ouagadougou says demonstrators gathered around the airport for the arrival of a delegation from the regional body, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).
The delegation was led by Senegal's President Macky Sall, the current Ecowas chair, and Benin's leader Thomas Boni Yayi.
Ahead of their arrival, the air and land borders were officially re-opened.
Security forces again fired in the air on Friday to disperse to demonstrators who burned tyres and blocked streets in the city, our reporter says.
Elections were due to be held in the West African nation on 11 October, nearly a year after a popular uprising forced Mr Compaore, the long-time ruler of the West African country, from power.
Coup leader Gen Gilbert Diendere, who was Mr Compaore's former chief-of-staff, told reporters that Mr Kafando was now in his official residence.
He was reportedly freed on Thursday but has not yet been seen in public.
Two other minister have also been released, the coup leaders say.
The decision to free them was made "as a sign of easing tensions and in the general interest", a statement read on national television said.
Prime Minister Zida was the army officer who took charge after Mr Compaore was ousted.
The lieutenant colonel was number two in the RSP, where he may still hold influence, which explains his continued detention, says BBC Afrique's Lamine Konkobo.
The elite presidential guard has been trained, in part, by the US. It is the most powerful armed group in Burkina Faso and often disrupted the activities of the transitional government as it tried to cling to the privileges it enjoyed under Mr Compaore's rule.
It is seen to be close to him, and is not popular on the streets. So its seizure of power could be a recipe for serious violence.
The transitional government might have made two mistakes - preventing politicians loyal to Mr Compaore from running in next month's elections and allowing the Reconciliation Commission, formed to heal wounds after the end of his authoritarian rule, to release a report calling for the presidential guard to be disbanded.
Some argue that a newly elected president would have had greater legitimacy to take such action.
Mr Compaore is currently in exile and was accused of committing widespread abuses, and trying to change the constitution to extend his term in office.
Some of his key allies had been barred from contesting the election.
Gen Diendere has said he has had no contact with Mr Compaore and will do everything to "avoid violence that could plunge the country into chaos".
An earlier announcement on state television said wide-ranging talks would be held to form a new interim government that would organise "peaceful and inclusive elections".
Transitional parliamentary speaker Cheriff Sy called for people to "immediately rise up" against the coup, and declared himself the leader.
The coup was announced on the day that a judge was due to give the results of DNA tests on the remains of former President Thomas Sankara, his widow Mariam Sankara told the BBC.
Her husband was killed in a 1987 coup that saw Mr Compaore and fellow officers such as his close friend Gen Diendere take power.
The family want to know the exact circumstances of his death, which have always been shrouded in mystery.

Input: NFU official Gordon Corner said 50 men and children were involved in an incident in Midville on Monday which "terrorised" a farmer.
A 24-hour dispersal order was put in place on Wednesday by police after officers received "a high volume of hare coursing-related incidents".
More than 2,000 calls have been made to Lincolnshire Police during 2015-16.
Hare coursing has been illegal throughout the UK since 2005. The Hunting Act 2004 makes it an offence to hunt wild mammals with dogs.
Mr Corner, an adviser for the NFU's Holland region, which covers that part of Lincolnshire, welcomed the dispersal order but said: "The thing is they need to catch them first so they can issue the order and hare coursing currently in Lincolnshire is out of control."
Speaking about the Midville incident, Mr Corner said the gang of 50 people drove across fields in 10 vehicles.
"One police car turned up quite quickly. The hare coursers dispersed, they caught seven men but we don't know what happened to them," he said.
"We've had lots and lots of meetings with them [police], we've had lots of discussions about how we and farmers can help. But we need to have some action.
"If [police] took the information they got and use it, then I think they would have a better success rate [with tackling hare coursing].
Tim Casey, a farmer near Coningsby, said some farmers were "at breaking point" and could be forced to tackle the crime themselves.
Rural crime officer PC Nick Willey said the force was doing all it could but added it should look at other ways of combating the crime.
The force's police and crime commissioner Marc Jones added: "I have recently contacted the chief constable to raise these matters and to make clear the importance I place on rural community safety.
"I believe the force is currently assessing the most effective operational response and yesterday's order is only the beginning."
Traditionally, coursing incidents start to rise in the autumn after crops have been harvested. They then continue until spring.

Input: The narrowing of the gap reflected a 2% increase in exports of goods and services, taking them to £43.8bn.
Imports fell by 0.5% to £48.3bn.
Although the pound fell sharply after the Brexit vote, which should make UK products cheaper abroad, the ONS said it was too early for firm conclusions.
The pound was 15% lower against other currencies in July compared with the same time a year ago, the ONS said.
The ONS points out in its release that the general consensus among economic commentators is that the recent depreciation in the pound should boost export and manufacturing competitiveness.
However, it says this does not necessarily occur as the price of imported materials used to make UK goods rises as  the pound falls.
Analysis: Andy Verity, BBC economics correspondent
Devaluation: the economic equivalent of caffeine. Drop the value of the pound by a tenth and your exporters get a stimulus; suddenly their goods are 10% less in dollars - making them cheaper and therefore more competitive. In the last week and a half, two striking economic updates have been published,suggesting the weak pound has helped.
Today it is the trade deficit. The fact that we as a country buy more than we sell - also known as a trade deficit - has been a persistent problem in the UK for at least two decades. But in July it narrowed by £1.1bn to £4.5bn. The other data was from manufacturers last week, who said the weak pound had helped stimulate the biggest jump in orders and new business for 20 years.
If that effect were sustained then it could help to achieve something the last government only talked about - the re-balancing of the economy. First, away from property and financial services and towards manufacturing and engineering - "making things" (remember the "march of the makers" - the phrase is four years old and empty). And second, away from our chronic dependence on borrowing and financial services to sustain economic growth.
However, be careful. As Matthew Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation pointed out to me on Twitter, finance may be smaller than it was before 2008, but so is manufacturing. And the trade deficit narrowed - but by less than most economists had hoped.
A weak pound may have stimulated the economy, but it has not suddenly improved our underlying economic fitness. Like caffeine, it will eventually wear off.
Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the figures were more evidence of the UK economy's "current resilience" - despite fears the Brexit vote would stall investment and spending.
He said hopes were pinned on the weakness of the pound encouraging a long-term increase in exports.
"A major hope for the UK economy going forward is that the substantial overall weakening of the pound since the UK voted to leave the European Union in June's referendum will increasingly feed through to boost foreign demand for UK goods and services," Mr Archer said.
Response list: ['The UK economy has narrowed its trade deficit, according to figures released by the ONS.']
Ground truth: The UK trade deficit, which reflects the difference between imports and exports, shrank to £4.5bn in July from £5.6bn the previous month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Input: The defendants, known as Soldier A and Soldier C, are the surviving members of the Army patrol which shot Joe McCann.
They are aged 65 and 67, and were in the Parachute Regiment.
They are from England, but are expected to appear in court in Northern Ireland in the next few months.
Joe McCann was a prominent member of the Official IRA. He was 25 when he was shot near his home in the Markets area of Belfast.
The original police investigation was conducted in the early 1970s and no-one was prosecuted.
Prosecutors have reviewed the case after the Northern Ireland Attorney General, John Larkin, referred it to the Director of Public Prosecutions in March 2014.
This followed a report in 2012 by a police team which investigated alleged crimes from the Troubles.
A spokesperson for the Public Prosecution Service said the decision to prosecute the men for murder was reached "following an objective and impartial application of the test for prosecution".
Response list: ['Two men who were killed in a shooting in Northern Ireland have been prosecuted for murder.']
Ground truth: Two former soldiers are to be prosecuted for murder in relation to the fatal shooting of an Official IRA man in Belfast in 1972.

Input: Williams, aiming for a 22nd Grand Slam singles title, thrashed Magdalena Rybarikova 6-2 6-0 in just 42 minutes.
Djokovic, a defeated finalist in three of the last four years, beat Chinese Taipei's Yen-Hsun Lu 6-4 6-1 6-1.
Earlier, Australian Open champion Angelique Kerber was beaten by world number 58 Kiki Bertens.
Fifth seed Victoria Azarenka was another high-profile casualty, forced to retire with a thigh injury when trailing Italy's Karin Knapp 4-0 in the third set.
But nine-time champion Rafael Nadal advanced at speed and in style, taking only one hour and 20 minutes to overcome Sam Groth 6-1 6-1 6-1.
The 29-year-old Spanish fourth seed, who hit an astonishing winner through his legs in the third set, will face Argentine world number 99 Facundo Bagnis in the second round after taking his career French Open record to 71 wins and two losses.
Djokovic will face Belgian Steve Darcis next, ahead of a potential third-round encounter with British number two Aljaz Bedene in the third round.
Djokovic, who won bronze at the Beijing 2008 singles and came fourth at London 2012, believes ranking points should be on offer at the Olympics.
The Olympics is organised by the International Tennis Federation, which has not reached an agreement with the men's and women's tours to recognise players' performances at Rio 2016.
John Isner admitted that the lack of points on offer was "a pretty big factor" in his decision not to represent the United States at the Games. Australian Bernard Tomic and Austria's Dominic Thiem have also made themselves unavailable to their countries.
"We have the best players in the world participating in arguably the fifth Grand Slam. It's of that importance for all of us, even more, because it happens every four years," Djokovic said.
"I would definitely encourage people to rethink getting points out there."
Third seed Kerber, who has yet to advance past the quarter-finals at Roland Garros, lost 6-2 3-6 6-3.
The German, 28, lost her opening matches at the Madrid and Rome tournaments and a shoulder injury ruled her out of Nuremberg last week.
Bertens, from the Netherlands, won the title in Nuremberg.
"First rounds are always tough in the tournament, especially for me. What can I say? It happens," said Kerber, who stunned Serena Williams in Melbourne to win her maiden Grand Slam title earlier this year.
Eugenie Bouchard is now down at 47 in the rankings but her form of late has been a little more encouraging and she eased past Germany's Laura Siegemund 6-2 6-2.
The Canadian had a difficult season in 2015 after reaching the top 10 the previous year and found the whole experience so stressful it led to an eating disorder.
She said: "I felt a lot of pressure and kind of this expectation that if you win a match it's normal and if you lose it's a disaster.
"Before matches I was very nervous and definitely had trouble eating. I just felt like it would come right back up. It's a difficulty I went through. And not just before matches, but it happened to me at other meals as well.
"So people think I was concerned about my body image and things like that and I was losing weight on purpose. That was really not the case. I was just so stressed."
Francesca Schiavone had to deny she was retiring after Roland Garros' Twitter feed mistakenly announced this as her final appearance.
The 35-year-old Italian, who won the title in 2010 and reached the final again the following year, was given a prolonged ovation after her 6-2 6-4 loss to France's Kristina Mladenovic.
"I appreciate this situation," said Schiavone. "But I think that everybody thought this because Roland Garros announced it. It was not the last one for me."

Instruction: In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.
Input: More than 800 members of the Colombian army have been jailed so far in the "false positive" scandal.
Civilians were murdered and their bodies passed off as those of rebels or paramilitaries to boost the army's combat kill rate.
Colombia's attorney general is investigating thousands more cases.
All of them are alleged to have happened between 2002 and 2008, when the scandal broke.
In a report published on Wednesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that it had seen evidence strongly suggesting that "numerous generals and colonels knew or should have known about 'false positive' killings, and may have ordered or otherwise actively furthered them".
Most of the soldiers convicted so far in connection with the scandal are of low rank, although some did command units or even battalions.
The rights group said that it had reviewed transcripts or recordings of testimony provided to prosecutors directly accusing several of Colombia's highest ranking officers of "having known of, planned, or attempted to facilitate false positive killings while holding those positions".
Among those named in the report as those who knew or should have known of the crimes are the former head of the Joint Caribbean Command, retired Gen Gonzalez Pena and the former army commander, retired Gen Mario Montoya.
One of the brigades implicated by the evidence is the 15th Mobile Brigade.
According to the report, the brigade is under investigation for 38 extrajudicial killings allegedly committed between 2006 and 2008.
Sgt Carlos Eduardo Mora was a member of the 15th Mobile Brigade and has been a key witness.
In 2007, he was working for the unit's intelligence division. He told the BBC that when he noticed suspicious activities he tried to alert some of his superiors.
He said that his superiors warned him that his family would be killed if he told anyone about what he knew.
Despite the threat, Sgt Mora reported his suspicions to the attorney general's office at the end of 2008.
The evidence he provided led to the conviction of a number of members of his former brigade.
Its former chief of operations, Jesus Rincon Amado, was sentenced to 35 years in jail for a murder committed in 2007.
Col Santiago Herrera Fajardo, who commanded the brigade, is currently on trial.
Prosecutors are also investigating members of the 4th Brigade for at least 44 alleged extrajudicial killings carried out between 2001 and 2003.
During that time, the battalion was under the command of Gen Mario Montoya, who was later promoted to lead the Colombian Army.
Earlier this week, the attorney general's office announced that it had summoned the now retired Gen Montoya and three other generals to give evidence in July.
According to the HRW report, the battalions which were led at the time by the current commanders of the Colombian army, Gen Jaime Lasprilla, and of the armed forces, Gen Juan Pablo Rodriguez, are also among those being investigated.
Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos defended the two officers.
He said that both men had shown him documents which demonstrate that "there is not one single investigation against" them.
President Santos said that although wrongdoing should be punished, that the army should not be "tarnished".
HRW says the investigations have been hampered by threats and attacks on key witnesses.
A ministry of defence official told the BBC that they were "providing every possible protection" to the witnesses.
Lt Col Carlos Javier Soler Parra said that the government had put a protection scheme in place for members of the armed forces who have acted as witnesses.
But Sgt Mora has said that he fears for his life.
In its report, HRW also quotes prosecutors as saying that members of the armed forces "placed obstacles in the way of obtaining files crucial to their investigations".
In a statement, the army denied this, arguing that it had put teams in place specifically tasked with providing the required information to investigators.
"We are the first ones interested in clarifying the facts," it said.
Regardless of the obstacles, the attorney general's office is currently investigating at least 3,700 extrajudicial killings that took place within more than 180 battalions and other tactical units, according to HRW.
Response list: ['A former army commander has been convicted of "knowing" of a series of extrajudicial killings in Colombia, a human rights group has said.']
Ground truth: Human Rights Watch has said that it has seen evidence suggesting high-ranking army officers in Colombia knew of the extrajudicial killings of civilians.

Input: They will be provided with a "disclosure pack" which "they may consider undermines the conviction in a specific case," a spokesperson said.
Three live cases where Mr Mahmood - dubbed the Fake Sheikh - was due to give evidence have also been dropped.
Mr Mahmood has previously said he used legitimate investigatory methods.
The decision to contact defendants was made after the CPS reviewed prosecutions following the collapse of the trial of former X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos in July.
The judge in that case said there were strong grounds for believing that Mr Mahmood had lied at a hearing before the trial started.
Subsequently, in a BBC Panorama investigation, one of Mr Mahmood's former colleagues at the News of the World claimed that they created elaborate stings to target celebrities unfairly.
As a result, former attorney general Lord Goldsmith told the same BBC programme that Mr Mahmood's record needed to be re-examined.
Lawyer Mark Lewis has been contacted by 16 people over possible civil claims against Mr Mahmood, including some not convicted of a crime.
He predicted that payouts to alleged victims if convictions are overturned could be "in financial terms, bigger than phone hacking ever was" because people have "lost their livelihoods, their homes and their incomes".
Mr Mahmood has previously said he has spent his career investigating crime and wrongdoing through legitimate investigatory methods, bringing many individuals to justice.
He said any criticism of him usually came from those he had exposed or people he had worked with who had an "axe to grind".
He is currently suspended from the Sun on Sunday following the collapse of Ms Contostavlos's trial.
A spokeswoman for the Sun said: "We are aware of the CPS statement. Mr Mahmood remains suspended and we are continuing our internal investigation into the matter."
A CPS spokesman said on Thursday that no defendants were currently in custody in cases involving Mr Mahmood.
In three live cases, prosecutors decided there was not a realistic prospect of conviction.
The spokesman added: "We are now considering past cases which resulted in a conviction in criminal courts in England and Wales based on evidence provided by Mr Mahmood, and have identified 25 cases.
"As part of this process, over the coming weeks, CPS Areas will be contacting representatives of the defendants - or defendants themselves as necessary - convicted in these cases in order to provide them with a disclosure pack - details of material which they may consider undermines the conviction in a specific case."
In September, several cases involving evidence from Mr Mahmood were halted.
The CPS offered no evidence against Dr Majeed Ridha and pharmacist Murtaza Gulamhusein, who were accused of illegally supplying an abortion drug.
Leon "Starino" Anderson and co-defendant Ashley Gordon also had drug charges dismissed.
Response list: ['A former Sun editor has been contacted by 16 people over possible civil claims against him.']
Ground truth: The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is to contact defendants in 25 cases where evidence was given by journalist Mazher Mahmood.

Input: The unfortunate creature did not survive the encounter with a high-voltage transformer at the site near Geneva in Switzerland.
The LHC was running when a "severe electrical perturbation" occurred in the early hours of Friday morning.
A spokesman for Cern said that the weasel did not get into the tunnels, just the electrical facilities.

Large Hadron Collider discovers new pentaquark particle
Arnaud Marsollier told the BBC that it would take a few days to repair the damage caused by the weasel's visit.
He added that while it was, fortunately, not every day that an animal affected the equipment, it was not that surprising as the research facility is in the countryside.
In 2009 the LHC was taken out by what was suspected to be a bird, though no remains were found.
Such "small issues" with the equipment were all part of the running of the LHC, Mr Marsollier said, and experts were used to carrying out repairs.
Cern's own report on the incident says that the weasel got into a 66kV transformer. The transformer connections were damaged.
"Not the best week for LHC!" it says.

Input: The "virtual orchestra" included everything from bell ringers to cellists, all of whom had uploaded their performance to the BBC.
A video combining all 1,200 performances was shown at Proms in the Park events around the UK and as part of BBC Two's coverage of the event.
The Prom also featured an unusual rendition of Rule Britannia.
Peruvian Juan Diego Florez chose to sing the anthem in B Major - the highest pitch ever chosen by a tenor at the event.
"I think it's more comfortable, more exciting, more fun," he told the BBC. "I'm glad that I'm the first one doing it."
The musician stole the show by performing the song in the colourful costume of Manco Capac, governor and founder of the Inca civilization.
Earlier, the dashing tenor had serenaded a cuddly toy of fellow Peruvian Paddington Bear during a performance of Guantanamera - part of a medley of popular Latin songs.
"He is as Peruvian as me," he told the audience. "You know, he was found in Paddington Station... [but] nobody in Peru knows about this.
"Anyway, I know him, I love him."
The build-up to the Last Night was marked by an attempt to hijack the concert's tradition of flag-waving for political means.
Anti-Brexit campaigners handed out EU flags outside the Royal Albert Hall, hoping for a wave of support from Prommers, who more usually wave union flags during the last night.
The organisers, who wanted to remain anonymous, said in a statement: "Music doesn't recognise borders, religion, gender, age, status or creed and most orchestras, shows and music schools rely heavily on talented musicians from inside and outside the EU."
They added: "Accordionist Romano Viazzani summed it up perfectly when he said: 'Music is the universal language. It builds bridges and tears down walls.'"
Prominent Brexit backer Aaron Banks retaliated by pledging to hand out five times as many union jacks as the Brexit team.
In the end, neither side prevailed - as the Royal Albert Hall sported flags from all around the world, including the German, Australian, Danish, Welsh and Cornish flags.
There was also a distinctly international flavour to the programme, conducted by Sakari Oramo, the Finnish music director of the BBC Symphony Orchestra.
He led the musicians through works by French, German, Russian and Italian composers; while Anne Dudley contributed a special arrangement of Fiesta Caribena!
Perhaps in response to the planned protest, Oramo told the audience: "Listening to music in a concentrated way gives us the chanceâ€¦ to find resolution, peace and unity.
"Music enables us to be in dialogue with each other, and our innermost selves. A dialogue which is more necessary in these days than ever before."
The concert also included Michael Torke's Javelin, which was originally performed at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and a hand-picked selection of young singers performing Vaughan Williams' Serenade to Music - a tribute to Henry Wood, whose name is synonymous with the Proms.
In keeping with tradition, the concert - and the 2016 season - closed with Rule Britannia, Land of Hope and Glory and Jerusalem.
Around the UK, classical music fans were able to join in the celebrations at Proms in the Park events; with special appearances by pianist Ruth McGinley and soprano Lesley Garret in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
Thirteen-year-old Gwydion Rhys was given the opportunity to conduct the BBC National Orchestra of Wales in a performance of Ride of the Valkyries at the Welsh Prom, in Colwyn Bay.
Britain's Got Talent winners Collabro appeared at the Scottish leg, in Glasgow Green; while London's line-up included Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, Rick Astley, Sir James Galway, Tim Minchin and the cast of Matilda The Musical.
The events brought the two month-long Proms season to a close, after more than 100 concerts.
Highlights included the  SimÃ³n Bolivar Orchestra, from Caracas, who put on a colourful, exotic evening, full of evocations of Latin America; and  a spine-tingling programme of Steve Reich, performed on the roof of a Peckham car park.
A late night Prom paid tribute to the life and music of David Bowie, with mixed results; while Quincy Jones and Strictly Come Dancing were also honoured with their own programmes.

Input: The Pope was shown pressing a button on an iPad tablet at the Vatican.
The message read:  "Dear friends, I am pleased to get in touch with you through Twitter. Thank you for your generous response. I bless all of you from my heart."
A spokesman said earlier the pontiff would "reach out to everyone" with accounts in eight languages.
After his introductory tweet on Wednesday, Benedict posted two follow-up messages.
By Alan Johnston BBC News, Rome
This venture into the Twittersphere is meant to reflect the Vatican's commitment to being part of the debate in cyberspace.
People are being asked to put questions to the Pope. And among those already posted, some are funny, and many others crude or silly. But some are sincere.
As one Vatican insider put: "The Pope's job description is to spread the word, and Twitter is a good way of doing that."
And being limited to the use of just 140 characters should not be too much of a hindrance.
The Christian message has often been at its most powerful when it's been at its most succinct.
Think of the Ten Commandments; "Thou shalt not kill" - just 16 characters.
They focused on promoting the Church's recently launched Year of Faith - an initiative intended to re-energise Catholicism.
"How can we celebrate the Year of Faith better in our daily lives?" the pontiff asked.
And he answered: "By speaking with Jesus in prayer, listening to what he tells you in the Gospel and looking for him in those in need."
Benedict's English account already has more than 700,000 followers and is growing fast.
So far, the Pope's accounts @pontifex - which mean "pontiff" or "builder of bridges" -  are only following each other.
Last year, the Pope sent his first tweet from a Vatican account to launch the Holy See's news information portal.
The leader of the world's 1.2 billion or so Roman Catholics is expected to sign off, rather than write, each individual tweet himself.
The Pope's tweets are also expected to highlight messages from his weekly general audience, Sunday blessings and homilies on key Church holidays as well as papal reaction to world events.
The Vatican has long shown interest in using the latest communications technologies to spread the faith with the inventor of radio, Guglielmo Marconi, setting up Vatican Radio in 1931.
The Catholic Church also already uses several social media platforms, including text messages and YouTube, to communicate with young people.
Papal aides say the pontiff himself still prefers to communicate in longhand rather than using a computer keyboard.
Pope Benedict's six-year papacy has been bedevilled by poor communications.
Embarrassing clarifications had to be issued over such thorny issues as his 2005 speech about Islam and violence, and his stance on condoms and HIV.

Ground truth: Pope Benedict XVI has sent his first much-anticipated Twitter message using his personal account.

Input: Most of those killed were residents of the building, which was being renovated when fire engulfed it last November.
State media said local government officials, construction executives, and some workers would face charges.
Officials have been accused of breaking safety practices by turning a blind eye to the rules in exchange for bribes.
The fire on 15 November was initially blamed on careless unlicensed welders setting alight the netting around the building.
Most of the victims suffocated from the smoke and fumes; another 71 people were injured.
The reports in the China Daily and the Shanghai Daily newspapers did not say when a trial might take place.
The fire had raised questions about how corrupt relationships between senior figures in the construction companies and in government bodies might have contributed to the lack of safety on site.
The Shanghai Prosecutors' Office Director, Chen Xu, said on Monday that some of the executives whose roles are now under the spotlight worked for the Jingan District Construction Group.
This was the general contractor in charge of renovating the 28-storey building.
China's work safety officials have blamed the fire on illegal contracting, unsafe materials and poorly supervised, unqualified workers.
The State Council - China's cabinet - ordered a nationwide overhaul of fire prevention measures after the blaze.
One of China's commercial hubs, Shanghai has some 20 million residents and at least 5,000 high-rise blocks.

Input: The festival, at Bramham Park, near Leeds, attracts around 80,000 people over the August Bank Holiday weekend.
Attendees often abandon sleeping bags and tents rather than carry them home.
Leeds No Borders, which campaigns on immigration issues, is one of a number of organisations which collects items left behind.
Emily Jennings, from Leeds No Borders, said volunteers had been shocked by the amount and quality of what had been abandoned.
"If we can share just a little with people who have nothing then that is at least one way forward."
Miss Jennings said the equipment they had collected would be sorted and cleaned before being taken to Calais.
Maya Conforti, from L'Auberge Des Migrants in Calais, says the salvaged kit will make a "big difference" at migrant camps.
She said: "There's been torrential rain in the last week which created huge flooding in the Jungle [the nickname of a camp in Calais], the place where the people survive, so we had to distribute tonnes of tents and sleeping bags."
"Conditions are way below international refugee camp standards, there are not enough toilets, the water points are dirty and there's no drainage.
"It's quite awful and there are about 3,500 people who live there. It's a European issue, an international issue."
Response list: ['A refugee camp in Calais has been left with a "big difference" in terms of what it can do, organisers say.']

Input: The Property Redress Scheme (PRS) does not take effective action, they say.
The PRS said it was not a regulator and could only help when an agent acted legally.
By law, letting agents cannot trade unless they are a member of one of three schemes, including the Property Redress Scheme.
However, dozens of customers of one rogue agent in London said when things went wrong, victims were not protected, a BBC You and Yours investigation has found.
Doni Soeyono bought a small two bedroom terrace house in Stanley Road in Ilford, east London 18 months ago as a rental property.
He signed up with Carter Stones, just round the corner in Connaught Road, which promised him a couple would rent the house for about £1,300 a month.
But in reality the couple Carter Stones claimed were renting the property did not live there.
Instead up to eight other people do, none with a contract. Mr Soeyono has not received any rent for six months.
He managed to get inside the house in the autumn and took pictures showing the sitting room with several beds.
When I went to the property with Mr Soeyono, we were shouted at by two women, who told us to go away. Then they left and walked down the street.
Mr Soeyono says he's seen one of the women a number of times and believes she lives in the property, helping to operate a subletting ring involving about 16 people.
But the owner says he has not had any useful response from Carter Stones.
Several landlords have contacted You and Yours complaining about unpaid rent, or legal documentation, and claim multiple people are living in the properties without any right to be there.
For more than 30 years, Teresa's family have owned a two bedroom terraced house in nearby St Mary's Road, Ilford.
She signed a management agreement with Carter Stones and was assured that a couple would be living in her house.
"Alarm bells rang when the council contacted me to ask who was responsible for the council tax at the house," Teresa said.
"They said many people were living in the house, but not the couple on the tenancy agreement."
Teresa says the people we met coming out of Mr Soeyono's house are also organising the subletting not only of her house but also her garage.
"I saw curtains up in the garage window, and the door was blacked out, but they would not let me in.
"Carter Stones declined all responsibility for this. They were not transferring me the rent and I couldn't get any sense out of them, even after telephoning them on a daily basis," she told me.
I tried to talk to Carter Stones, but while I could see two people in their office, each time I knocked they hid behind the door.
Since 2014 it has been a legal requirement for letting agents to be a member of one of three government-approved dispute resolution schemes: the Property Redress Scheme, the Property Ombudsman or the Ombudsman Service.
The Property Redress scheme costs £200 to join. It is run by the insurance company Hamilton Frazer, and unlike the two other organisations it is run for profit.
Carter Stones used to be a member of the PRS.
Last year the PRS upheld four complaints against Carter Stones but the company failed to pay compensation of £15,406. The PRS cannot enforce that order - the only redress it has is to expel rogue traders.
So in March 2016 the PRS expelled Carter Stones, making it illegal for the firm to continue trading. When Carter Stones stayed in business, Trading Standards became involved.
Redbridge Trading Standards then fined Carter Stones £5,000, but the company did not pay, and continued to trade. Trading Standards is still investigating.
In November 2016, seven months after Carter Stones was expelled from the scheme, Shakeel Ahmed paid £2,350 as a deposit to secure a flat to rent.
Even though the flat fell through, Carter Stones kept his money.
Several other prospective tenants have since contacted me with the same story.
When the landlords and prospective tenants complained to the PRS, they were told that as Carter Stones had been expelled from the scheme, nothing could be done.
"The PRS is pretty much useless," Mr Soeyono told me.
Teresa said: "The PRS is not effective at all, absolutely not in the case of a rogue agent. They're just using the scheme for their benefit."
The PRS does not require letting agents to sign up to a code of conduct, and does not publish a list of companies that have been expelled on its website.
Paul Shamplina, who is on the PRS advisory council, said that none of the redress schemes are regulators, but are "escalated complaint handling schemes put in place to prevent service related complaints from having to be issued in the court by consumers.
"This allows them access to a much quicker and cost effective remedy to resolve matters with property agents."
However, he said that when companies do flout the law, redress schemes are powerless, and complainants must rely on Trading Standards.

Response list: ['A property agent who has been expelled from the Property Redress Scheme has been told that the scheme is useless.']

Input: Officers said a man on a quad bike was reported to have shot the raptor at about 17:15 on 4 May.
He was driving on moorland close to the B7040 at Elvanfoot when he fired the weapon. Witnesses reported that he drove off before the police arrived.
Landowners Leadhills Estate appealed for "information and clarity" over the reports.
Hen harriers are considered rare and are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act.
The man on the quad bike had his face covered at the time of the shooting, according to RSPB Scotland.
Sgt Craig Smith said: "Police Scotland is committed to tackling wildlife crime and reducing the number of crimes against our iconic birds of prey.
"We will continue to work with partners and the public to protect Scotland's wildlife.
"At this time I am asking for anyone who witnessed a man on a quad bike between Elvanfoot and Leadhills on the evening of Thursday 4 May to please contact police. You may hold valuable information which could assist our inquiry."
RSPB Scotland's head of investigations, Ian Thomson, said: "This latest incident shows very clearly how protected birds of prey continue to be treated in some areas of our uplands, particularly where there is intensive grouse moor management.
"The hen harrier is an increasingly rare bird in southern and eastern Scotland, with illegal killing the main driver of this long-term decline.
"This incident occurred only a few miles from where a satellite-tagged harrier, known as Annie, was found shot a couple of years ago, and is close to where another tagged bird, Chance, disappeared mysteriously last spring."
A spokesman for Leadhills Estate said: "The first we knew of this incident was a newspaper report and we contacted police immediately with a view to assisting them.
"At this stage we do not know the details of the incident but if a hen harrier has been shot we wholeheartedly support the police investigation and have launched our own internal inquiry.
"We want to make clear our condemnation of all forms of wildlife crime."
The estate said Leadhills was not currently an active grouse moor.
The spokesman added: "The estate acknowledges that 13 years ago and nine years ago gamekeepers were convicted of wildlife crime offences while employed by sporting tenants who had sole responsibility for sporting operations.
"Since October 2013, the estate has directly been responsible for sporting operations. We, and our staff, are wholly committed to the highest standards of moorland management."

Input: Former England defender Ehiogu died at the age of 44 on Friday after suffering a cardiac arrest the previous day.
Southgate and Ehiogu formed a centre-back pairing for almost 10 years at Aston Villa and Middlesbrough, winning the League Cup together at both clubs.
"He was a gentle giant away from football, he was a colossus on the pitch," Southgate said.
Ehiogu, who was Tottenham's Under-23s coach, was taken to hospital on Thursday after collapsing at the club's training ground, but a statement said he had died in the early hours of Friday morning.
Capped four times by England, Ehiogu made over 200 appearances for Villa between 1991 and 2000 and then spent seven years at Boro. The defender also played for West Brom, Leeds, Rangers and Sheffield United, before retiring in 2009.

"Most importantly, he was a gentleman and he is one of those characters that people would find it difficult to have anything bad to say about him.
"I probably played more games with Ugo than anybody else in my career and while in many ways he was a gentle giant away from football, he was a colossus on the pitch. It felt like a true partnership with Ugo because we were prepared to put our bodies on the line for each other.
"We shared highs, lows and won a couple of trophies together with Villa and Boro and it's those memories that I will always cherish when I think of Ugo.
"He was one of the most professional people I played with in terms of how he applied himself to his job and it was great to see him progressing through the coaching pathway with that thirst for learning.
"I've spoken to several of our former team-mates today and there's just a sense of disbelief that we're having these conversations.

Input: The eastern side of Aleppo has been pulverised.
Running water and mains power are a memory. It is hard to find a building that is not badly damaged. Many look as if they could collapse at any time.
Rubble from the buildings that were flattened by artillery fire, barrel bombs or air strikes block many of the streets.
Dozens of bulldozers have been working for more than a month to clear a path through the debris.
East Aleppo remains a deeply inhospitable environment.
But the UN estimates that 40,000 people so far, and more every day, have decided to come back here. They are moving into their old homes or unoccupied buildings that look as if they might do, for a while at least.
Abu Hussein, a man in his 50s, was remarkably cheerful as he stood with his wife Umm Hussein and looked down from their balcony on to the rubble that makes his street impassable for any vehicle.
"Nothing is better or more beautiful than our home," he said. "It's the place to be in good times or in bad."
His family's flat is in Shaar, one of the poorest quarters in East Aleppo. The area is made up mainly of cramped concrete tenements five or six stories high - at least those still standing.
In Abu Hussein's street, some buildings have collapsed in on themselves.
Others have had the fronts ripped off, like dolls' houses in a nightmare, exposing beds still made up with sheets and blankets, and sofas teetering close to falling into the street.
Abu Hussein said he was happy because he was home, even though his flat was dark and cold.
His wife cooks on a small charcoal grill on the stairwell.
The glass in the windows has gone. It is so well ventilated that the dank mist of a winter's evening seeped in.
He had spent much of last year with his in-laws, he said, and the sooner they tried to make a go of it back home the better.
Abu Hussein and his wife have a two-year-old son who is still with her parents. They have no jobs, and the small amount of money they had saved went long ago.
"Of course we have hope," Umm Hussein said. "We'll rebuild and we'll find a solution."
They left East Aleppo two days before the start last year of the major offensive by the Syrian army, backed by Russia and Iran, which by Christmas had beaten the rebels and reunited the city.
During the years when the east was isolated, then besieged, it was possible to cross to government-controlled West Aleppo.
Abu Hussein said the trip, which now takes 15 minutes, was possible for anyone who was prepared to take a 17-hour journey through territory controlled by Syria's galaxy of armed groups, including the rebel Free Syrian Army, Kurdish militias, the jihadists of so-called Islamic State, and the armed forces of the Syrian government.
The United Nations, which spent more than $200m (Â£162m) on relief work in Aleppo last year, is particularly concerned that the poor in Shaar have come back out of desperation to a place that is still dangerous.
Relief agencies have put water tanks in the streets. Children struggle through mud and rubble to help their families by carrying water home.
Aleppo has changed since the government and its allies won the battle for the city last month.
It no longer feels like a wartime city. Outgoing artillery fire is still a steady drumbeat, aimed at rebel front lines that are not far away.
The country is at war. But Aleppo's war is over. In the ruins, people are thinking about the future.
Slowly but steadily, some of Syria's millions of displaced people are returning, desperate or optimistic, or both.
Large areas of the east side of the city are ghost towns, but there is every chance that more returnees will come back looking for a home once the weather gets warmer in the spring.
The battle for Aleppo was the most decisive of the war.
It is a long time since the war was merely a contest between President Bashar al-Assad and armed groups who wanted to destroy the regime.
So many foreign powers have intervened that this has become an international conflict. Syria has layers of war and not all of them are about the future of the Assad regime.
The intervention of Russia and Iran tipped the balance in Aleppo. Mr Assad and his allies can, for the first time, smell victory.
Foreigners, not Syrians, are setting the pace. And at the moment it looks as if foreign powers will dictate how the war ends.
Response list: ["A man in Aleppo's Shaar street is watching as his family's home is being rebuilt."]
Ground truth: For the people who have returned to the ruins of East Aleppo the old phrase "there's no place like home" has a whole new meaning.

Input: In May 2016, police reports of hate incidents in schools were up 89% on the same month in 2015, the figures show.
The Times Educational Supplement obtained the data from 30 police forces under Freedom of Information law.
Robert Posner of the Anne Frank Trust UK said racist language had become more accepted since last June's referendum.
Mr Posner, chief executive of the charity, which runs a national programme tackling prejudice-related behaviours among young people, told the TES that the charity had heard more "disparaging" comments in school workshops since the vote.
"Language that we might consider to be either racist or prejudiced has become more normal and more accepted recently," said Mr Posner.
The TES sent freedom of information requests to all 39 of England's police forces.
Of the 32 forces to respond, 30 provided comparable data.
The figures revealed that compared with the same periods in 2015:
There were warnings of increases in bigoted behaviour among pupils at both the National Union of Teachers and Association of Teachers and Lecturers annual conferences last month.
A small survey of 345 ATL members published during their conference showed that more than a fifth of teachers had noticed hate crime or hate speech incidents in their schools during this academic year, and 17% believed it was a growing trend among pupils.
At the time, the union's general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said schools needed to educate children "to build a culture of tolerance and respect" as part of their anti-bullying policies.
"We hope that schools can support staff to educate young people in recognising and challenging hate crimes and hate speech wherever they occur," said Dr Bousted.
At the end of July last year the government announced a review of the ways in which police in England and Wales handle hate crimes and bullying against pupils and staff from minority groups after a sharp rise in the month after the EU referendum.

Input: Mr Osborne is meeting other finance ministers of the G20 group of major economies in Moscow.
The UK, Germany and France want to reform rules which let firms switch profits and costs between countries.
Labour's Ed Miliband said he "didn't see much evidence" Mr Osborne was actually tackling the problem.
Several well-known firms have been criticised over the amount of tax they pay on large UK revenues.
The BBC's Hugh Pym says the issue is "high on the list of priorities for policymakers at a time when companies like Amazon, Starbucks and Google have come under fire over the size of their tax payments".
The emergence of details regarding tax-avoidance strategies by multinational firms has sparked controversy, and calls for an overhaul of tax laws will be highlighted to finance ministers by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),  in a report published this week.
By Hugh PymChief economics correspondent, BBC News
The tax policies of Amazon, Google and Starbucks have intensified the debate about corporate behaviour and pushed it high up the agenda for policymakers.
Everyone agrees there is a limit to what national governments can do to close loopholes in a world of globalised capital flows where big companies can easily move profits to low tax regimes.
Today's G20 developments mark a move towards an international crackdown.
George Osborne and his French and German counterparts will be powerful advocates for change at future meetings.
But it is only a start.  And, as the chancellor has acknowledged, in a low growth climate governments need to take care not to deter multinationals who might invest in their economies.
The chancellor told BBC News: "We want a tax system that makes it competitive for businesses to set up in Britain and create jobs, but we also want a tax system where business pay their taxes and that's what we're setting up achieving here with other countries at this meeting in Moscow.
"International companies are an important source of jobs - we want them in Britain. We are making sure the taxes in Britain are low but we do expect those international companies to pay those taxes.
"The international tax laws for these companies have not really changed in decades, even though the international economy has changed a lot - people shop online, for example - and so the only way to deal with that is to work with other countries to make sure the international tax laws change and then international companies will pay their fair share of taxes."
But Labour leader Ed Miliband said: "George Osborne makes lots of promises on tackling tax avoidance, but I don't see much evidence of it.
"What he should be worrying about is the living standards of people in this country.
"Of course, he should be dealing with tax avoidance, but one of the things he's doing is cutting taxes for the richest people in society - Â£100,000 tax cut for the richest people in Britain - the wrong thing to do at a time when everyone else's living standards are squeezed."
The UK will chair a committee set up by the OECD looking at "transfer pricing" - how global firms calculate the payments passed between their subsidiaries in different countries - which can be used to shift profits from high-tax jurisdictions to lower-tax ones.
The committee is one of three looking at the tax issues which will help the OECD prepare a "plan of action" to be put forward to the G20 in July.
Germany will head a panel looking at the ways in which companies have reduced their tax base - their taxable income and assets - while France and the US will jointly consider the problem of identifying the correct tax jurisdiction for business activities, particularly e-commerce.
Mr Osborne said Britain had cut its corporation tax rate by more than any other country in the G20 over the past two years, which he said was "a message to the world that we are open for business that has seen companies return to Britain, and helping to create and secure thousands of jobs and millions in investment".
He said: "Our commitment to the most competitive corporate tax system goes hand in hand with our call for strong international standards to make sure that global companies, like anyone else, pay the taxes they owe.
"That's why Britain, with Germany and France, asked the OECD to scrutinise the international rules, and we will together welcome their report to the G20 this weekend. The report shows this is an international issue that requires international action."
The chancellor said global tax rules "have stood still for almost a century", adding that "Britain will lead the international effort to bring them into the 21st Century".
He wants to use Britain's presidency of the G8 in 2013 to push international progress on the reform of international tax rules, which were first developed by the League of Nations in the mid-1920s and remain essentially unchanged.
Response list: ["Britain's chancellor George Osborne has said he wants to tackle tax avoidance by working with other countries to make international tax rules more competitive."]
Ground truth: Chancellor George Osborne has renewed his call for international action to tackle so-called "profit shifting" by multinational companies to avoid tax.

Costa trod on Emre Can and Martin Skrtel in a second-leg tie that saw the Londoners progress after extra time.
The Football Association is waiting on referee Michael Oliver's report before deciding on whether to take any action.
Mourinho insisted the Blues striker was blameless, claiming he was only "looking to the ball".
But Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said: "He has this edge to him. With Emre Can, that was poor, I felt."
The first-half incident involving Can took place close to the technical area and prompted an angry response from the Liverpool player.
Rodgers felt Costa could have avoided treading on his player.
"He could easily hurdle over the young player and he directs his studs right on to his ankle, which could've been nasty," said the Reds boss.
"Again, the one with Martin Skrtel, there's no need to do it. That's the sad thing. He's a top-class player and he's clever enough that the officials don't see it."
Chelsea reached the final thanks to Branislav Ivanovic's goal, although they would have progressed on away goals having drawn 1-1 at Anfield in the first leg.
But most of the post-match talk centred on Costa.
Mourinho feels the Brazil-born Spain international is being targeted unfairly, with one unnamed television pundit in particular leading the way.
"There is a campaign on the television with a certain pundit that is saying Diego Costa 'crimes'," said Mourinho. "This guy must be nuts.
"Great campaign. We know how much that pundit loves Chelsea and particularly loves me."
Mourinho declined to identify the pundit, adding: "I don't know his name, because when I see him I switch off the television."
Costa was involved in three of the game's main talking points - he also had a penalty appeal turned down when tripped by Skrtel - and could face retrospective punishment from the FA for the two alleged stamps.
If he is banned, Costa would miss Saturday's Premier League clash with second-placed Manchester City at Stamford Bridge.
In a fiery second half at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho appeared to row on the touchline with Liverpool counterpart Rodgers.
The Portuguese described himself and Rodgers as "very different people", referencing the time they worked together at Chelsea.
"I don't know if he learned something with me or not," said Mourinho. "Maybe he did, maybe he didn't."
He went on to criticise Rodgers for failing to praise Reds goalkeeper Simon Mignolet in his post-match television interviews.
"He speaks about [Chelsea keeper Thibaut] Courtois, he forgets Mignolet," said Mourinho. "I speak about Courtois and Mignolet.
"He forgets his goalkeeper. I don't forget my goalkeeper, because my goalkeeper helped me to be in the final.
"He is what he is. He is a fantastic manager, but we are different people."
Rodgers played down talk of an issue between the two managers.
"There is no problem," he said. "It's a competitive game between two top sides and the chimp comes out every now and then."
Response list: ['Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has said he is "very different" from Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, with the Portuguese manager "saying he was a chimp".']
Ground truth: Diego Costa's alleged stamps during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final win over Liverpool were "absolutely accidental", says boss Jose Mourinho.

She had made 125 reports to Devon and Cornwall Police about Willis' stalking before the attack in 2013.
The force said its "investigation and victim care did not meet the high standards we expect".
Ms Pearson said the apology "didn't do anything" for her and said she was "still suffering every day because of what happened to me".
More on this story, and other Devon news
The stalker and the woman who refused to give in
"All I can hope is that what happened to me means police officers get more training and deal with victims of stalking better - so that no-one else has to go through what I did," she said.
Willis was jailed for life for attempted murder.
A court heard that Ms Pearson's flat and car had been targeted by Willis, abusive messages were daubed on the streets around her house and threatening letters were sent to her between 18 January 2009 and 21 October 2013, when she was attacked.
The force said its Professional Standards Department had found cases of misconduct against three officers, one of whom had retired.
There was no detail immediately available on what action was taken against the other two officers.
Two further officers did not have a case to answer, but were given "management guidance and advice".
New orders planned to give stalking protection
Alexis Bowater, former chief executive of Network for Surviving Stalking, said she was "still, sadly, getting calls from victims saying that police are not taking their complaints seriously".
"They call it murder in slow motion," she said. "Taking stalking seriously is murder prevention."
Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer had met the Pearson family and "offered a personal apology to them", the force said.
Deputy Chief Constable Paul Netherton said "numerous changes" in the force's stalking investigations had been made since the attack.
Officers were given "appropriate and regular training" and the force would "continue to strive to ensure that this type of incident is not repeated".

Input: Mrs Foster said that she hopes that talks on a Tory-DUP arrangement will conclude as soon as possible.
She said it should be no surprise that the DUP wants a reference to the devolution of Corporation Tax in the deal.
The Stormont Executive has long aspired to reduce its Corporation Tax rate.
Previous Northern Ireland executives have wanted to bring it down to 12.5%  to match the corresponding rate in the Irish Republic.
Previously, the Treasury has argued that Stormont would need to pay for such a move by taking a cut to its block grant from London of several hundred million pounds a year.
However, Mrs Foster told the BBC's Inside Politics programme that her party wants to explore whether that remains the case because, in the light of Brexit, they argue that European Union (EU) state aid rules should no longer apply.
The DUP leader believes there is "a very good chance" of devolution being restored at Stormont.
She pointed out that the DUP had just achieved its greatest ever election result and said the party would not countenance anything regarding Sinn FÃ©in deciding who the DUP's nominee for first minister should be.
On abortion, Mrs Foster said there is a broad swathe of consensus that the 1967 Act should not apply to Northern Ireland.
However, she said her party would go back and look at an expert report on the issue of fatal foetal abnormality which is understood to recommend legal changes.
The DUP leader noted that her party no longer has the numbers on its own to launch a petition of concern in the Stormont Assembly blocking same-sex marriage.
Asked if it would no longer seek such a veto, Mrs Foster said she would not tie her party down in relation to that matter and discussions about the Petition of Concern system were continuing between the parties.
Questioned about the DUP's relationship with loyalist paramilitaries, Mrs Foster said her party had never sought any endorsement from any group.
She repeated that she would have "no truck" with anyone engaged in paramilitarism or criminality.
Asked about the political rollercoaster which has seen her removed from office as first minister then become the Kingmaker at Westminster, Mrs Foster said she had been kept going by the support of ordinary people.

On Brexit, the DUP leader said she believes high tech equipment to monitor goods crossing the Irish border will be ready in time for the UK's departure from the EU. She said developing such a capacity would involve cooperation between the private and public sectors.
Asked what she meant by a "sensible" Brexit, Mrs Foster said her party is talking to Northern Ireland's ports to see how they think trade should be handled.
Noting that 73% of goods coming through Belfast port are going to or coming from Great Britain, Mrs Foster said one thing which would not work would be a border down the middle of the Irish Sea.

Input: Leah Bracknell starred in the ITV series, set in the Yorkshire Dales, from 1989 to 2005.
Her character was known for storylines which raised awareness about mental health and LGBT issues.
Ms Bracknell, who is now a yoga instructor, shared her diagnosis on an internet fundraising page set up to raise money for treatment in Germany.
As of Friday afternoon, more than Â£35,000 of the Â£50,000 target had been raised.
On the fundraising page 52-year-old Leah, who is known to her family as Ali, said she had been teaching yoga workshops and starting rehearsals for a comedy play before she received the news.
"It turns out that the universe had other plans. Life was about to be unexpectedly turned on its head," she said.
"I began to feel breathless climbing stairs... I just put it down to a bit of stress.
"My abdomen suddenly ballooned - and within a matter of a few days I looked heavily pregnant. I could barely walk or breathe."
After an emergency procedure to remove excess fluid from around her heart, Ms Bracknell said she was told she had stage four lung cancer, which she described as "a fairly brutal and bleak diagnosis, but one I am determined to challenge".
Her partner Jez Hughes explained the funds will be used for "immunotherapy and integrative medicine, which are seeing previously 'incurable' cancers going into complete remission".
Ms Bracknell played vet Zoe Tate, sister to Chris Tate and daughter of Frank Tate, one of the main families in the soap.
During her years on the show Zoe Tate came out as lesbian and later suffered from schizophrenia.
She made a dramatic exit when she left the village, blowing up Home Farm where the family had lived.
She won the 'Best Exit' award at the British Soap Awards in May 2006 for her performance in the scene.
It is one of the most exciting avenues of cancer treatment which uses the body's own immune system to fight off cancer.
Our immune system is like a police force, protecting us from diseases.
Normally our immune system spots and destroys faulty cells - like cancer ones - but sometimes these can escape detection and develop into tumours.
Instead of targeting the cancer cells themselves, as many traditional cancer drugs do, immunotherapy reawakens the immune system so it can "remember" the cancer and stop it in its tracks.
A number of immunotherapy treatments are already showing considerable promise.
Response list: ['A 52-year-old woman who was a star of the soap opera "The Yorkshire Dales" has been diagnosed with stage four lung cancer.']
Ground truth: The actress who played Emmerdale's Zoe Tate has announced she has terminal lung cancer.

Input: Little is known about critical care delirium, or ICU psychosis, which triggers psychological effects in patients in intensive care.
During delirium some patients believe doctors are trying to kill them, they see ghostly figures, suffer hallucinations and anxiety.
Most patients recover quickly with the correct help.
A recent study found that some 55% of people who survive intensive care treatment  go on to develop psychological disorders like depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.
Frances, who did not wish to give her surname, was in intensive care in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast for four weeks following complications during her second heart bypass.
She had never heard of critical care delirium.
"When I became aware, firstly, I had terrible hallucinations. Other patients were not in their beds, they were in pop-up cars. There were people dressed as ninjas at each side of the bed.
"I felt they were going to harm us and we had to be good. Looking back now I believed they were trying to kill us and they did it by injecting your stomach.
"On one occasion, I even hid in a cupboard to try and stop them killing me.
"When my family came to see me I was begging them to take me home and told them if they didn't take me home I would be killed that night. I started to text people and tell them to come and get me. It was worse for my family knowing I was so unhappy," she said.
"It would be reassuring for families to know that it is actually a condition and it's not just happening to you.
"You do feel very embarrassed about it and you don't want to bring it up because you feel so embarrassed."
A recent study of 157 patients at University College Hospital, in London, found high levels of depression, anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder.
Dr George Gardiner, a clinical lead at the Critical Care Network in Belfast, has been studying critical care delirium. He said the condition is not unusual.
"The symptoms are caused by the environment and the critical illness suffered. They are upsetting and unsettling for the family and friends who will also see what is going on. It is something we in the intensive care unit have been concentrating on for the last ten years," he said.
International research has been focused on trying to improve how to spot the symptoms to treat the condition and the Critical Care Network has developed a number of scoring systems to try and pick it up at the earliest stage in patients.
"There are a series of cognitive tests to see if a patient is in the zone of delirium and that is what Frances has been experiencing, a condition called critical care delirium.
"There are a number of strategies which can be used to try and normalise the environment. Introducing night and day when that can be done, reducing sedation when possible and freeing patients from the equipment. That's something that we are trying to push forward here in Northern Ireland."
Dr Gardiner explained that, by definition, a patient in intensive care has a critical condition and that it is not surprising that the brain starts to malfunction in this way.
He understands how patients can begin to slip into delirium.
"By the very nature of the monitoring we have to do and the equipment that is needed to support your organ systems night and day it can be difficult to differentiate, there can be noises, there are alarms and there is always a stranger, albeit a nurse in the room with you," he said.
"Never the less it is quite common for patients, especially the more critical patients, to lapse into delirium and sometimes it can be quite difficult to pick that up."
Dr Gardiner has been involved in trying to reduce the chances of patients suffering from delirium.
"The strategy we employ in NI is to have the patient as lightly sedated as possible and move them out of intensive care as soon as possible. We are having good success at this.
"We never get the opportunity to let people know that delirium is a common effect of being in critical care and we are looking out for it and we can treat it. Most people will make a good recovery. It might take a bit of time but patients should be assured we are on top of the issue.
"We can treat this and people will get back to normal."
Response list: ['A patient who experienced delirium after being in intensive care has been helped by a team of nurses.']
Ground truth: It is a condition which is rarely talked about and most people are too embarrassed to mention it after they recover.

Input: "Gerard Depardieu was very insistent," Thierry Fremaux told the Associated Press.
"He really wanted us to show it."
Fremaux had initially turned down United Passions, but eventually agreed to an open-air public screening on the beach.
"At the beginning I said 'Out of the question', because the film lack[ed] the quality to be part of the official selection," he said.
"Then they said, 'Why not on the beach?'. I said, 'Ah, the beach. Yes, it's a festival. It's football. It's the general public. Okay'."
Depardieu attended the screening with then-Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who recently resigned from his post amidst the corruption scandal that has engulfed world football's governing body.
Fifa largely paid for the Â£17m film out of its own coffers, only to see it mauled by the critics and flop at the US box office.
The film, in which Tim Roth plays Blatter and Depardieu plays Fifa founder Jules Rimet, went straight to DVD in France and has been released in only a handful of other countries.
However Fremaux refused to pour yet more scorn on the film, saying he did not "find the movie horrible at all".
Response list: ['French director Thierry Fremaux has refused to criticise the football documentary "United Passions" after it failed to get the top 10 of the box office.']

Input: Supt Steve Furnham said infrastructure in Lens is "very limited" and fans should watch the game in other cities.
Welsh officers will join colleagues from England and Northern Ireland as 500,000 UK nationals head to France.
Supt Furnham also said banned fans will get a "knock on the door" if they do not surrender their passports.
A police delegation from Wales travels to Sweden with the national team for a friendly on 5 June and then on to Paris the next day.
"We are there until Wales get knocked out or win it. Hopefully the latter," South Wales Police's Supt Furnham said.
Their role will be to patrol host cities and fan zones as well as offering guidance to French police on safety, security and how to engage with Welsh fans.
Supt Furnham said officers chosen from Wales are "very experienced" who regularly work at domestic games as well as at internationals.
A total of 87 Welsh fans issued with banning orders after incidents in the UK have until Wednesday night to surrender their passports.
"The very fact they have been arrested indicates they are a risk," he said.
"We've worked really, really hard to reduce the number of arrests at games across the country. Arrests are down and we want that to continue."
With a fan zone capable of holding just 10,000 fans, a handful of bars and a ban on consuming alcohol on the streets of Lens, Supt Furnham warned ticketless Wales fans against going to the city for the game with England on 16 June.
Lens has a population of less than 40,000 and with the stadium holding just 35,000, concerns have been expressed about a large influx.
"If you haven't got a ticket to Lens, don't go," he said.
"It's been well documented in the last couple of weeks that the infrastructure doesn't lend itself to large numbers of football fans going there."
He said other cities are better equipped such as Bordeaux, where there will be a fan zone capable of hosting 60,000 people.
Response list: ['Welsh police have been asked to patrol the city of Lens in France as part of a "fan zone" for a friendly match against England.']

The gates officially opened at 08:00 BST but people reported long queues to get on to the site.
One ticket-holder told the BBC he had been in the queue for "about four and a half hours" and only moved half a mile.
"We're trying to get in the campervan field but we're glad we've come today because we think it's going to be even worse tomorrow," he said.

Others took to social media to vent their frustrations, with Angela Gibbon tweeting: "7 hours in the queue now...so near yet so far away!".
Steve Saunders posted a shot of the roadside saying: "This is a view of a hedge we've had for a hour. It's a beaut!" while Patrick Dear tweeted: "Talking about necessary survival plans now - which of us to eat first."
Mike Ross said he had "never been on a roundabout long enough to take a nap before" and Moira tweeted that she had "been in this traffic for 12 hours, that's longer than any of my relationships".
Mr Eavis said he was "sorry for the delay" but the problem was because "people were coming before the gates were open".
"We did ask people to postpone their trip by about six or seven hours but instead of that - funnily enough - more people have come early this time," he said.
"I don't mind them coming early but they're going to have to wait because we don't have the staff or the car parks until 8 o'clock in the morning."
Festival organisers earlier advised people "not to set off" yet or "grab some essentials" for the journey.
A temporary campervan and caravan holding site was set up at the Bath and West show ground near Shepton Mallet and festival-goers were advised to go there.
Avon and Somerset Police said traffic was queuing on the A37, north and south of the A361 junctions, with further congestion around the A303.
The force advised people to avoid the area "unless absolutely necessary".
Somerset County Council said traffic heading to the festival had caused widespread disruption.
It said a number of school buses had been caught up in the traffic, and were running late or not at all.
Residents described the gridlocked roads as a "traffic disaster".
Lorry driver Jason Barnes called the situation "absolute carnage" and said: "In six hours I've only driven 11 miles. I'm supposed to be working".
Nigel White said the A39 through Ashcott was "virtually at a standstill" while Judith Templeman said "no other event would be allowed to cause this level of mayhem".
"If they can't handle the influx of people in an efficient way so as not to cause this level of disruption on all the access routes around Shepton Mallet... then it should be stopped or limited to the number that can be processed efficiently," she added.
Frome MP David Warburton tweeted it had "not been so bad for years" and he would be writing to Mr Eavis as this was "not good for Somerset".
The Met Office posted a weather update on its Twitter account, saying further outbreaks of rain over Glastonbury this morning had added to the "already very wet ground conditions."
Pictures emerged on Monday showing flooding at the Somerset site, with paths under water and camping areas already turned into mudbaths.
Muse, Adele and Coldplay are all headlining the main Pyramid stage over the weekend.

Input: Chief executive Inga Beale told the BBC that Lloyd's may set up a subsidiary or branches in mainland Europe.
She estimates that 4% of revenues could be lost after Brexit because Lloyd's would lose its licence - or passporting - rights to operate across the EU.
The fallout from Brexit "is a major issue for us to deal with", she said.
Lloyd's, one of Britain's oldest institutions, is the world's leading insurance and reinsurance market and houses around 90 syndicates. It focuses on specialist markets, such as marine, energy and political risk, and this year insured the taste buds of a Cadbury's chocolate taster.
Continental Europe accounts for about 11% of gross premiums written by the London market. Ms Beale told the BBC that Lloyd's was now "focusing our attention" on maintaining its position in a post-Brexit landscape.
It had not yet been decided whether to establish branches in individual EU countries or an EU-wide subsidiary, but the latter option would probably be cheaper, she said.
But Ms Beale said Lloyd's had to respond. "It's the lack of certainty for our clients. Business cannot hang around," she said. "Boards are going to insist that they make plans [for life after Brexit]"
She did not disclose details of the size of any EU-based subsidiary or consequences for jobs, but said: "Some people may end up doing their jobs in other parts of Europe rather than in London."
Her comments came as Lloyd's reported half-year pre-tax profits of Â£1.46bn, up from Â£1.20bn for the six months last year.
Despite the rise, premiums continue to be under pressure, said Lloyd's chairman John Nelson.
He said: "Whilst we are operating in difficult conditions, we have continued to make significant progress in growing our presence in the fast-growth markets across the globe.
"In 2016 we have applied for onshore reinsurance licences in India and Malaysia as well as opening a new office in Bogota, Colombia. This complements the growth we are seeing in Dubai, China and in our more traditional markets, particularly the United States."
Response list: ['Lloyd\'s chairman Inga Beale has said the insurance giant is "focusing our attention" on maintaining its position in the UK after Brexit.']

Input: Buthelezi starred as his own great-grandfather King Cetshwayo, but could not attend the original premiere because of restrictions imposed by the apartheid government.
He was joined by Prince Harry and Welsh actor Sir Stanley Baker's widow.
The event was raising money for charities helping wounded soldiers and African children.
The screening is a digitally re-mastered version of the 1964 film starring Sir Michael Caine, which recounts the battle of Rorke's Drift in 1879, when some 150 British soldiers - many from Wales - held off around 4,000 Zulu tribesman whose land they had invaded.
Lady Ellen Baker said it would be "lovely" to see Buthelezi again.
She said: "We formed a great friendship."
Buthelezi, 85, who played his own great-grandfather in the film, has described how the set was an "oasis" where "whites and blacks could mingle without any fuss".
Lady Ellen said Sir Stanley, who took the lead role as well as co-producing the film, had been determined to treat the warrior extras in the film with respect - despite its location in apartheid South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province.
"Stanley had to be very skilful and diplomatic," said Lady Ellen, whose husband was from Ferndale, Rhondda. "It was the height of apartheid."
Funds raised at the Leicester Square Odeon screening are going to Walking with the Wounded, Sentebale and The David Rattray Memorial Trust.

The bank said they will include "advanced security features" and their designs will be unveiled in the coming months.
All four Northern Ireland banks print their own money, a tradition stretching back to the early 19th Century.
Ulster Bank's senior brand manager Lita Notte said it is "an important part of our business heritage and the economy of Northern Ireland".
The new banknotes feature designs on the theme "living in nature", influenced by a panel of historians, botanists, artists, architects and members of the public.
"The notes are in the final stages of their design phase," Ms Notte said.
"They are a unique demonstration of what matters to those who live and work here in Northern Ireland."
Earlier this year, Ulster Bank said that plastic notes will "probably be more cost-effective" than paper currency.
They are said by the Bank of England to be cleaner, safer and stronger than paper notes.
Last year, the Bank of England released its first polymer note but the first plastic £5 had been introduced 17 years previously in Northern Ireland by Northern Bank.
Ulster Bank said it will engage with retailers to help them adapt to the new polymer notes.
There is about £2.5bn worth of Northern Ireland banknotes in circulation and Ulster Bank has been producing notes for 181 years.
Existing Ulster Bank £5 and £10 notes will remain in circulation until 2019, when they will be removed.

Input: Derbyshire Cave Rescue Organisation (DCRO) was called out after three cavers failed to return from a trip into Gautries Hole, north of Buxton.
Heavy rain had caused a section of passage close to the entrance to become completely flooded, leaving the cavers with no way out.
They were rescued by the team using underwater breathing apparatus.
Bill Whitehouse, from the DCRO, said: "They were very experienced cavers who knew what had happened and what the consequences were.
"They did exactly the right thing and found somewhere to hold-up until help came."
He added: "Once they were beyond the flooded part of the cave they were quite safe - it's just they couldn't get out."
The team took the decision to "dive them out" because the water level was not going down and more heavy rain was forecast, meaning they could have remained trapped for a long period.
Mr Whitehouse said it was unusual for the cave to be totally flooded.
Response list: ['A team of cavers who had been trapped in a cave for 12 hours have been rescued after they were rescued by a team of divers.']

Input: Keshi said an un-named agent submitted his name without his knowledge for a job as Ivory Coast coach.
For his part Enyeama says he thought his case closed after apologising for his "uncomplimentary remarks" about security in Kaduna.
His comments came ahead of of June's Africa Cup of Nations tie against Chad.
The NFF felt his comments breached a code of conduct signed by all players earlier this year.
Keshi, who signed a new two-year deal with the NFF in April, was on a list of 59 applicants published recently by the Ivorian federation to succeed Frenchman Herve Renard.
Top NFF official Chris Green has been widely quoted in the local media as saying they may travel to Abidjan to enable them 'reach a reasonable conclusion' on the matter.
Enyeama believed his issue had already been dealt with.
"I was told to apologise for my comments, which I did immediately and they told me that's fine," Enyeama told BBC Sport.
"Personally, as it was resolved in-house I thought that was the end of the matter.
"I only received a letter to cautioning me about it [my comments] and to avoid a repeat of such."
The 32-year-old, who is the Super Eagles most capped player with 101 appearances, denies he failed to reply to messages from the NFF seeking an explanation for his comments.
"But I only found out about a disciplinary hearing in the media but I didn't get any letter to that effect," he explained.
"As the captain I only raised our concerns about the venue before our game which didn't go down well with the football authority.
The Lille player could face a lengthy ban for his comments which the NFF feels broke its recent code of conduct signed by the players as well as his failure to attend Tuesday's hearing.
The NFF executive board will have the final say on any punishments, on a date yet to be decided.
It has also been confirmed that the Super Eagles will play their next home 2017 Nations Cup qualifier against Egypt in Kaduna next March.

The 2013 US Open champion hit a four-under-par 67 to win on 16 under.
Open champion Stenson took silver with a 68, while American Matt Kuchar carded a 63 to claim bronze on 13 under.
"That felt better than anything I've ever won," said Rose.
"It was the best tournament I've ever done. Hopefully we've shown Brazil what golf is about. I'm glad it was close. Not for my nerves, for golf."
While several other high-profile golfers had decided not to compete at the Olympics, Rose had relished the prospect of becoming an Olympian since the moment the sport's return to the Games was confirmed in 2009.
Such was his eagerness to be part of the experience, he arrived the week before the Olympics officially started to ensure he was part of the opening ceremony.
The Englishman made history by hitting Olympic golf's first hole-in-one in the opening round and started Sunday with a one-shot lead, before shooting four birdies and just one bogey on his outward nine.
Stenson carded birdies in four of his first 10 holes and drew level with Rose when the leader dropped a shot on the 13th.
It looked like a play-off would be needed to separate them but Rose held his nerve on the par-five last, chipping his approach to two feet from the hole, while Stenson's spun away to around 20 feet.
The Swede then raced his birdie putt eight feet past the hole and missed the return to allow Rose the luxury of two putts for victory. He needed just the one.
Former world number one Tiger Woods: "Thrilled for Rosie, Henrik & Kuch, but all golfers in Rio this week should be proud."

Thousands of taxi drivers protested recently in the Indonesian capital against transport apps.
The drivers said ride-hailing apps such as Uber have made it impossible for them to earn a living in the city.
Uber started operating in Jakarta in the later part of 2014. The car-hire service also operates in other Indonesian cities - Bandung, Surabaya and the popular tourist destination Bali.
It is calling its latest offering "uberMOTOR", which it claims will allow anyone in Jakarta to "push a button and get a motorbike ride in minutes".
The company says its pricing is the "most affordable" in town, with a base fare starting at 1,000 Indonesian rupiah ($0.08; Â£0.06).
Earlier this year, thousands of cab drivers in Paris also staged a protest, against competition from app-based taxi services including Uber.
The Uber service is available in 380 cities around the world. The company has said it is profitable in the US. But in China, Uber is losing $1bn a year. And that is partly due to fierce competition.

Input: Hughes has been out ever since suffering concussion in the match against Cardiff Blues on 12 August.
"The recovery process following head injuries is well-documented," said Dragons backs coach Shaun Connor.
"You can't afford to rush players back, and that's what you'd expect from your medical staff as well."
Wing or centre Hughes, who is in his second spell with the Gwent region following time at Exeter Chiefs, is likely to feature in the 23 to face the Russian side Enisei-STM in the European Challenge Cup.
Despite the long absence, Connor told BBC Wales Sport that 26-year old Hughes' future had not been in doubt.
"Never, it's always a long process and Adam always had the intention of fighting his way back to fitness," he said.
His return comes amid controversy over the introduction of tougher World Rugby guidelines issued to referees on dealing with high tackles, in an effort to reduce the number of concussions.
Scarlets lock Jake Ball and Ospreys fly-half Sam Davies were both yellow-carded in the first round of PRO12 matches since the changes in interpretation.
Dragons flanker Nic Cudd, who is often among his team's leading tacklers, hopes the change will not affect them because of their tackling style.
"All the boys are aware of it, we saw the Scarlets highlights and it's being refereed in a different way," he said.
"We've got to be careful but on the whole we're a leg-tackling team so hopefully it shouldn't affect us too much.
"They are being strict with it so we've got to keep away from that shoulder-up area, but if anything the new laws should suit us. If it improves player safety, I'm all for it."
Response list: ['Adam Hughes is expected to return to Scarlets after a long absence, according to Dragons coach Shaun Connor.']
Ground truth: Newport Gwent Dragons three-quarter Adam Hughes is fit for a comeback five months after a head injury in a pre-season friendly.

Input: Three men from a group of six entered the Park Lane hotel's boutique and smashed jewellery and watch cabinets.
The group was disturbed by police at about 01:37 BST but escaped on three mopeds with some items.
The Met followed but lost the gang and came across a woman who had been hit by a moped at Cambridge Circus.
The 25-year-old was taken to hospital for treatment for leg injuries and has since been discharged.
Det Con of the Flying Squad Alex Flanagan said: "This was a well planned and thought through robbery and there may be people who know who is responsible.
"I am keen for those with any information, no matter how small, to come forward and assist us with our investigation."
Response list: ['A robbery of a boutique in Cambridge has left a woman with a broken leg and a man with a broken arm.']

Input: The only failsafe answer of course is not to talk about politics at all.
But it's a very real question that the prime minister faces right now. He says ministers who want to campaign to leave the EU will be able to do so in the runup to the vote.
But on this subject, that has so divided the Conservatives in the past, how can he stop what will be an energetic debate in the party doing lasting damage?
The Downing Street headed notepaper, the clarifications of parliamentary precedent, and the careful words all look terribly polite.
But in David Cameron's three-page letter to his ministers this afternoon, there are some robust messages to his own side, and evidence of his own anxieties about the self-harm the Conservatives could indulge in during the coming months.
It was only last week that he succumbed to the (almost) inevitable and said that ministers will be able to vote according to their beliefs, and campaign to leave the EU in the referendum. But the PM clearly believes the decision alone is not enough. So, to try to rein people in, he's published a set of rules.
First off, in no uncertain terms, ministers are told to keep quiet on the subject until he reaches a deal, expected in the middle of next month.
But even after the negotiations are complete, the letter states that ministers will only be able to give their overall positions on the basic question, stay or go.
He writes "all other EU or EU-related businessâ€¦will continue to be subject to the normal rules of collective responsibility".
So, a row between the Home Office and Brussels over a new European regulation?  A spat between DEFRA and the EU about environmental regulations?
Under David Cameron's rules, Eurosceptic government ministers would not be allowed to use evidence from normal government business to make the case to leave.
And ministers who want to leave the EU won't be able to use the power, the drama of Westminster itself to argue for exit.
Number 10 will not allow Eurosceptics with jobs in the government to campaign for Out from the backbenches, nor will they be allowed to speak at length on the issue from the despatch box.
If they are asked a question by an MP that requires them to make reference to an EU issue, they will be able to point out their own position, while also referring to the government policy.
But that's as far as it goes, whereas the prime minister, and those who are expected to campaign to stay will be able to argue for the government position, almost inevitably making the case to stay.
Tonight, it's prompted accusations there simply is one rule for one side, another for the other. Campaigners for Out are gleefully pointing out tonight that ministers are being given less licence to express their views than Liberal Democrat ministers were under the coalition.
The civil service won't be neutral, and will support the government's position "in the normal way".
Eurosceptic cabinet ministers I've spoken to are relatively relaxed about the suggestions, but with one important caveat, that the prime minister does not use the immediate aftermath of the summit where he agrees the deal, to hail it as a huge breakthrough before they are allowed to make their case.
With summits finishing on Friday afternoons, and the Cabinet traditionally meeting on Tuesday mornings, there are nerves about a vital 72-hour gap where the campaign to stay could suddenly have huge advantage.
Most telling perhaps is what the letter tells us about the political dangers of this project, probably the biggest risk David Cameron has ever taken.
He calls for Conservative ministers to remain a "united, harmonious, mutually respectful team".
The fact he feels the need to spell that out suggests just how worried he may be about polite disagreement descending into bitterness.
Response list: ['The prime minister has written a letter to his ministers, warning that they will be given less freedom to campaign for or against leaving the EU.']
Ground truth: How do you stop a polite conversation about politics, even with your nearest and dearest, descending into a slanging match?

Input: Shropshire Fire Service was called to The Mill Hotel in Alveley, near Bridgnorth, shortly after 05:00 BST.
Area manager John Das-Gupta said the blaze had "compromised the integrity of the building".
The service said it received numerous calls alerting it to the fire "due to smoke being visible from a number of miles away".
The Shropshire service sent 11 fire engines and was supported by firefighters from across the region, including from Staffordshire, the West Midlands and Hereford and Worcester.
An investigation has begun into the cause of the blaze.
Earlier, area manager Andy Johnson said the fire involved "the whole of the building", which covers three floors.
Because of the scale of the blaze crews were expected to remain at the site through Monday night.
Neil Griffiths from the fire service said crews were unable to get into the building itself because of its fragile state. A structural engineer is on site.
The Mill Hotel, which was a popular wedding venue, closed unexpectedly last September as a result of the financial problems of its owner, Elysian Care..
The building dated back to the 16th Century and was once a working flour mill, according to Visit Heart of England.
The 41-bedroom hotel had been "carefully restored and extended" with many of the original features maintained, the tourist information website said.
Response list: ["A fire at a hotel in Shropshire has caused a major disruption to the area's tourism industry."]
Ground truth: A fire has torn through a disused hotel in Shropshire, causing most of the building's roof to collapse.

Input: Media playback is not supported on this device
Scot Anderson, 44, led the match 3-0 but, with Lewis suffering "disgraceful" abuse, allowed the Englishman to reel off eight legs in a row to secure an 8-3 victory.
When asked if he intentionally lost, Anderson told BBC Scotland: "Yes.
"I didn't want to win a game where that happened; I thought it was a disgrace."
Anderson subsequently issued a statement on social media, saying he "would never intentionally lose a match".
Lewis, 30, had beer thrown at him during his entrance to the arena, and coins were thrown onto the stage during the match.
"It was bad that night," said Anderson, who beat Lewis 10-4 in the final two months later.
"I'm a proud Scotsman but when that happened, it sickened me. Aidy is a good friend of mine. It was terrible."
Anderson said it was not "right" for him to win the game.
He added: "If I'm going to play a game, I'm going to play it right. With them doing that, Aidy couldn't play with that going on."
Anderson, who beat Phil Taylor in January's PDC World Championship final, says abuse of that magnitude is something he rarely encounters on the darts circuit.
"I play all over the world and I had never seen it before," he added.
"It cheesed me off. I don't know why it happened, and I hope it will never happen again."
Response list: ['Scot Anderson says he "would never intentionally lose a match" after losing to a Scottish player who was "disgraceful" abused.']
Ground truth: World champion Gary Anderson has revealed he deliberately lost a Premier League match against Adrian Lewis at Glasgow's SECC in 2011.

Input: Lillis made a hash of collecting Paul Taylor's cross in the 89th minute, spilling the ball and allowing substitute Gwion Edwards to head home.
Rochdale took the lead twice in the first half only for Peterborough to peg them back.
Andy Cannon volleyed the opener eight minutes in, firing through a crowded penalty area to beat Ben Alnwick in the Posh goal.
Shaquile Coulthirst threatened the Dale goal on a couple of occasions before Marcus Maddison raced onto Hayden White's pass down the right flank and fired wide of Lillis for the equaliser.
Dale were back in front in the 31st minute when Jermaine Anderson clipped Joe Rafferty's heels and Ian Henderson slammed the resulting spot-kick straight down the middle of Alnwick's goal.
But the visitors were quick to restore parity, Chris Forrester blasting a fierce drive past Lillis from 25 yards.
After an evenly contested second period Posh won it late when Lillis spilled Taylor's cross and Edwards headed into the unguarded net.

Input: Barrett finished on 114, the highest score by a Northants number 10, to back up the contributions of Crook and Rob Keogh (154) as the visitors made 551.
But Worcestershire then responded well in the day's final session.
Daryl Mitchell (86*) and Tom Fell (61*) were both there at the close on 153-1.
So far, the pair have shared an unbroken stand of 145 - matching Northants' ninth-wicket partnership earlier between Crook and Barrett.
Inside 34 overs, they fell just nine runs short of the county's ninth-wicket record, but they still surpassed the previous best for the ninth wicket in matches against Worcestershire, the 137 shared by Jack Timms and Reg Partridge at Stourbridge in 1934.
Crook's career-best 145 overtook his 142 not out last summer against the Australian tourists, while South African Barrett's innings beat the 106 by Gus Williamson, batting at 10 against Cambridge University in 1960.
On a day when Worcestershire vice-captain Joe Leach (3-121) passed the landmark of 50 Championship wickets for the second successive season, the home side lost England Lions all-rounder Brett D'Oliveira for an 11th-ball duck.
But captain Mitchell then weighed in with his best score of the summer, well supported by Fell, before bad light ended play prematurely.
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"Anyone coming in at number 10 and getting a hundred has done a great job. Jack Shantry has done that sort of thing for us.
"It is a flat wicket and our two guys played really well, Tom Fell and Daryl Mitchell, who is nicely poised for what could be his first century of the season.
"They have just started to get the ball to reverse a little bit and that will be a little bit trickier. We need to get a big score and potentially pull out if we avoid the follow-on.
"But that's easier said than done. We've got to get there. We've got nearly another 300 runs to go and that is ultimately our plan at the moment."
Northants century-maker Chad Barrett told BBC Radio Northampton:
"I couldn't have wished for a better Championship debut. I've had to wait two years for my opportunity. It was a decent wicket and I had to make the most of it.
"Two years waiting to play a second first-class game (the first was against Sri Lanka) is a long time. You think to yourself 'Am I going to play another one?'
"When I got the nod, I thought when I have a bat or a bowl, I've just got to show what I can do.
"We said we'd try to get to 500 which is a big milestone and to get to three figures myself was my own milestone. I had faith in Ben Sanderson while I got there. I know he can hold a bat and is more than capable."
Response list: ["Northants' Chad Barrett and Worcestershire's Daryl Mitchell have both scored 145 in a Championship match."]
Ground truth: Northamptonshire tailender Chad Barrett made an unbeaten century on his debut, to back up Steven Crook's career-best 145 as Worcestershire were made to toil for a second day running at New Road.

Input: The farmers say the land is being taken away before compensation is agreed.
Traffic in central Delhi was gridlocked for hours as they were addressed by opposition politicians.
The use of land for industrial purposes is hugely controversial in India - protests have stalled similar projects elsewhere in the country.
The government in Uttar Pradesh state has bought the farmers' land to build an eight-lane highway and business zone between Delhi and Agra, an important industrial centre that is also home to the Taj Mahal and other popular tourist sites.
Earlier this month, three farmers in the state were killed when police fired at protesters demanding more compensation.
The BBC's Mark Dummett, who was at the protest in Delhi, says the project is exactly the kind of large-scale development that India needs to create more jobs, but the farmers say they stand to lose out.
Hundreds of millions of other Indians feel the same way, our correspondent says, and will not let land their families have farmed for hundreds of centuries be handed over easily or cheaply as the country rushes to industrialise.
"When our land is taken away, where will we live, where will our children live? They're trying to grab our land!" said one farmer at the protest.
"We haven't agreed on the compensation amount, and our lands have already been transferred to private companies!"
Another protester accused the government of trying to acquire the land cheaply.
"It's our heritage, our livelihood. When we don't have our land, what will we do - become a Maoist or a terrorist?"
India's governing Congress party says it hopes to push through a new law soon guaranteeing higher levels of compensation for farmers who lose their land.
Response list: ['A protest in Delhi has been held to demand more compensation for land that is being sold to a private company.']
Ground truth: Thousands of farmers have held a protest in the Indian capital, Delhi, against the forced acquisition of their land for a new motorway.

Input: Sixth-seed Konta, 25, was 3-0 up in the decider but German Siegemund took five straight games to progress 3-6 7-5 6-4.
The match ended at 02:17am local time and defeat means British world number seven Konta has still won just three games on the surface in her career.
Siegemund will face Estonia's Anett Kontaveit or American Coco Vandeweghe.
The world number 30 won the second WTA Tour title of her career last week at the Stuttgart Open.
She started poorly in the Spanish capital as Konta broke serve twice to take the opening set but then fought back to claim a tie-break in the second having been 5-4 down.
And she showed the same battling qualities in the decider, fighting back from three break points that would have given Konta a 4-0 lead to win the game and subsequently the match.
Response list: ["German Petra Siegemund has won the Australian Open women's singles title after defeating 25-year-old Brit Anna Konta in a thrilling final."]
Ground truth: Johanna Konta's struggles on clay continued as a final-set slump saw her lose to Laura Siegemund in the first round of the Madrid Open.

Input: Darren Jackson, 51, was serving part of his life sentence at HMP Sudbury when he was reported missing on Tuesday.
Jackson killed Gill Ellis in Burnley in 1984, when he was a teenager, by stamping on her stomach and tearing a main blood vessel to her heart.
He was jailed in March 1986, went on the run in 1997 and was later freed but then recalled to Sudbury Prison.
Ms Ellis, from Burnley, was mugged as she walked across Hargher Clough Recreation Ground on her way home from a Christmas party in 1984, the Lancashire Telegraph reported.
As she lay unconscious, Jackson, also from Burnley, stamped on her stomach - splitting her pancreas and fracturing her ribs, the trial at Manchester Crown Court heard.
The prosecutor said Ms Ellis's liver had "virtually exploded".
Jackson was found guilty of murder and jailed for life.
In 1997, he escaped from HMP Ranby, in Nottinghamshire, and went on the run for three days before giving himself up after he was spotted.
He was released in 2007 - after serving 21 years of his sentence - but was later recalled to Sudbury Prison.
Police have described him as white, 6ft 4ins tall, slim, with short cropped grey hair and a tattoo on his wrist. His last known addresses was in Oldham and Burnley.

Instruction: In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.
Input: Chirp was launched in 2012. It's an application that allows you to transfer files between devices simply using an audio signal. It was instantly appealing - and best of all it was the work of a British inventor, Patrick Bergel, from University College London.
Bergel and his team had big ambitions, seeing Chirp as a whole new platform for exchanging anything from photos and video to cash. At the time I wrote: "This may be an app that just proves a passing craze - but how inspiring to meet a British start-up with such Californian ambitions."
Three years on they have made some modest progress, running experiments with retailers using the app to send marketing messages, but it's fair to say this is still a brilliant idea rather than a proven business. Then today another company which also has plenty of Californian ambitions moved onto the same territory.
That business is Google, which has launched a plug-in for its Chrome browser called Google Tone. The idea is that nearby computers can share links by opening a Chrome tab, then sending out an audio signal. It's very similar to what Chirp does, although for now it has more limited applications.
That might seem like curtains for the tiny British venture, which has just embarked on a crowdfunding drive, using the Crowdcube platform to raise the modest amount of  money it needs to get to the next stage. But Patrick Bergel says the opposite is the case.
"I've been going on about 'the internet of sound' for a while, so we definitely see this as validation. Competition is a good thing." Until now, he has struggled to get London investors to back Chirp, explaining tactfully that they are "not always as open to brand new ideas as Californian venture capitalists".
It seems there is an appetite in the UK for me-too businesses - another social network or photo sharing app - but a reluctance to put money into original British technology.  But now Bergel thinks he might get a better hearing: "If you're the only person in the marketplace it's hard to convince people that it's a good thing."
What is more, Chirp had been on the point of releasing its own Chrome plug-in. Having heard about Google's Tone, it has rushed it out this morning, and says its version does more, allowing you to send all sorts of links, pictures even phone numbers from websites to another device.
What happens next will tell us something about how the UK has come as a place to launch a new technology business. If Google's hunch is right, sharing files via an audio signal is an idea whose time has come. Venture capitalists should be beating a path to Patrick Bergel's door to find out about the internet of sound. But if he wants a hearing, maybe he'd be better off heading to California.
Response list: ['A British start-up has launched a new app that lets users send files between devices by sending them as audio signals.']
Ground truth: A few years ago I came across one of those rare inventions that make you sit up and go "wow".

"Players should be more responsible. Social media plays a massive part," Grayson told BBC Radio 5 live.
"The club has dealt with it internally. He has admitted and apologised that he was bang out of order."
Grayson left Preston for Sunderland in June, with the task of reviving a club relegated from the Premier League last season.
The Black Cats start the 2017-18 Championship season against Derby on Friday.
Jermain Defoe, Jordan Pickford and Fabio Borini have all left the Stadium of Light, while the Black Cats have brought in more modest recruits such as Aiden McGeady, James Vaughan and Jason Steele for the challenge ahead.
"There isn't a great deal of money to spend," Grayson added. "We've got a decent enough budget but it's still way short of a lot of other clubs around us.
"The players we've brought in so far haven't been significant signings compared to the rivals who have come down spending huge amounts of money.
"What I'm trying to do with (chief executive) Martin Bain is get the club some stability, where they don't have to spend millions of pounds, and that they can do it on a lesser budget than Sunderland have been used to.
"We're trying to bring some pride back to the area and the club. Over the past few years it's been in a dark place and mismanaged."

Input: In Rhyl, Denbighshire - one of the worst-hit areas - evacuees are being cared for at the town's leisure centre, and 400 properties are without power.
Many were ferried to safety by the RNLI and emergency services.
Another high tide is expected in the area just after midnight, but serious flooding is not expected.
Thursday's storm hit the coastline about lunchtime causing major disruption with roads closed, schools shut and trains stopped.
Two severe warnings - suggesting there was a danger to life - had been issued for the area earlier on Thursday.
In Rhyl, one of the worst affected areas, a rest centre has been set up at the leisure centre for residents and schoolchildren forced to leave buildings because of the tidal surge.
At one point, up to 400 people were being cared for there, but about 90 remained by Thursday evening.
Denbighshire council said 400 properties were without power, in addition to the homes that had been affected by flooding.
At least 25 residents and six dogs were rescued and two inshore lifeboats manned by RNLI crews and assisted by the fire service ferried people to safety from flooded bungalows in Rhyl.
At the height of the flooding, the fire service dealt with 34 flood related calls in a four hour period.
By Chris DeardenBBC Wales News
Most of the flood water in Kinmel Bay, Conwy, has receded, though the local Asda car park is still under water, and water surrounds a nursing home like a moat.
But it's the possibility of further flooding this evening which is now worrying residents as the light begins to fade.
Supermarket staff are busy reinforcing the front doors with sandbags on both sides, and on the seafront, council workers are placing concrete blocks against the flood gates to make sure they hold.
One resident, Kieran Jones (pictured above), has even bricked up his own doorway to give extra protection.
A builder by trade, he said: "I used rapid hardening cement so it will set before any flood waters arrive this evening.
"It was quite scary to see the flood waters coming towards the house this morning.
"We were lucky they didn't get inside the house earlier, but I don't want to take any chances tonight."
Red Cross volunteers were also helping in Rhyl, sending 4x4 vehicles to help with evacuations.
All of the flood warnings were lifted across north Wales at about 16:00 GMT including the highest state of alert at Greenfield, Bagillt and Point of Ayr.
Earlier, people living near the River Dee at Saltney, Flintshire said they could not remember the river being so high and several cars were caught in the flood water.
A BBC reporter at Talacre, Flintshire said the area was "like a ghost town an hour and a half after the evacuation.
"The Dee estuary is bubbling away like a broth."
There were reports that the defences had broken.
During the height of the storm, scaffolding being used in roof repairs at an Aldi store in Mold, Flintshire, collapsed onto cars in high winds.
An Aldi spokesperson said: "Although nobody was hurt in the incident, we immediately evacuated the store."
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) had warned that high tides and gale force winds could "cause sea surges at their highest levels for the last 10 years, possibly 20 years".
Strong winds of between 60-70mph (97-113km/h) had been reported on the Llyn peninsula on Thursday morning.
The NRW had urged people to keep away from sea fronts and said emergency response workers were at "key sites".
Roads in Wrexham were also affected by fallen trees. Emergency teams went to Ruabon, Johnstown and Wrexham bypass, among other areas.
Flintshire Bridge which straddles the Dee at Connah's Quay was closed.
Meanwhile, Virgin Trains stopped services between Chester and Holyhead.
And Arriva Trains Wales said some of its services had  been hit.
The flooding was caused by a storm surge from a combination of low pressure and winds of up to 70 mph, causing water to pile high.
At high tide, the sea level rose by at least a metre above usual levels.
The highest wind speed was 77mph inland at Capel Curig in Conwy.
Elsewhere, a 50 tonne tree fell on top of a car, blocking the A40 near Crickhowell, Powys.
Those inside were taken to hospital Dyfed-Powys Police said they are not believed to be seriously injured.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We are in contact with the UK Government on the general situation, and with Natural Resources Wales and responder agencies in Wales on conditions in North Wales."
The Met Office expects the worst of Thursday's weather to hit north and west Scotland and parts of north and eastern England, and has issued an amber "be prepared" warning.
Flood alerts updates and information are available on Floodline 0845 988 11 88.
Response list: ['A 100-year-old house in Rhyl has been completely flooded by a storm surge.']
Ground truth: About 400 people were forced to leave their homes after high tides and gale force winds battered north Wales causing flooding.

Input: Murphy lost to Stuart Bingham in last year's final but gained revenge with a 10-9 Grand Prix win in Llandudno.
The 33-year-old was 2005 world champion and is keen to win snooker's biggest tournament, which starts in Sheffield next month.
"I got to within three frames of winning last year, let's see if I can go three better this year," he said.
"I think if I can prepare in the same way as I did last year and continue doing the right things that I think I'm doing with my coach and my team, then I arrive in Sheffield in great form and good nick," he said.
"It doesn't mean you're going to win - it doesn't mean you're going to win your first match. But I'll give myself the best possible chance."

"I had a fantastic year in 2015 - victory in the Masters, nearly winning the world title and nearly winning the German Masters as well but nothing quite beats taking trophies home," he said.
"That's what we play for. That's what it's all about. No-one comes for second place.
"It's very difficult winning ranking tournaments. With three events left of the season it really points to good things for me "

Input: Li Heping was sentenced in a closed-door trial, Chinese state media say.
He has defended other prominent lawyers, including Chen Guangcheng and Gao Zhisheng, as well as practitioners of the banned Falun Gong movement.
A representative of campaign group Amnesty International questioned the validity of the allegations against Li.
The lawyer was detained in 2015 as part of a wider government crackdown on dissent under President Xi Jinping.
His trial took place on Tuesday in the Tianjin City Number Two Intermediate People's Court and concerned state secrets, the court said on its Weibo social media account.
In its ruling, the court said that since 2008 Li had used social media and foreign media to "smear and attack state organs and the legal system".
It also said he had used foreign funds to "interfere in high-profile cases" and colluded with several people "harbouring subversive ideas", including lawyers and those "involved in illegal religious activities".
His jail sentence had been suspended for four years and he would be denied his political privileges, the court said.
The suspension means Li could be released imminently, although it is unclear whether he has been. His time spent in detention should also count towards his jail sentence.
Amnesty International's China researcher, Patrick Poon, said that holding the trial in secret showed allegations against Li were "groundless and weak".
Wang Qiaoling has not seen her husband for the best part of two years but, like a number of other wives of the lawyers detained in July 2015, she has been a tireless campaigner for justice.
Despite the risks, she has continued to conduct media interviews about the lack of due process in the case against her husband.
The suspended prison sentence, announced without warning, will on the one hand be a relief because it ought to mean that Li will now be released. But it will also almost certainly mark the beginning of another long period of surveillance and control for the family.
Ms Wang has already refused a request from the authorities to travel to Tianjin to meet her husband, insisting instead that he should come home to her.
"He is not free, the authority wants to keep controlling him, that's why the authority tried to take me to Tianjin to meet my husband to legitimise their unjust means," she told the BBC.
Response list: ['A Chinese lawyer who was arrested in 2015 for "smear and attack state organs" has been held in a closed-door trial.']
Ground truth: One of China's best-known human rights lawyers has been given a three-year suspended jail term for subverting state power.

Input: Customers of RBS and its subsidiaries, NatWest and Ulster Bank, were unable to use Visa debit and credit cards.
An RBS spokesperson said the breakdown had "minimal customer impact".
It said the problems affected "a small number of people" conducting higher value and international transactions.
The problems started at 7.45am and were resolved by 9.15am, the bank said.
On Thursday, the bank was fined £56m by UK regulators over its huge systems crash in 2012, when 6.5 million customers - equivalent to 10% of the UK population - faced problems that lasted in some cases several weeks.
Also on Friday Barclays online customers experienced some difficulties with their service for a short time.  A Barclays spokesperson told the BBC: "Barclays online banking service was unavailable for around an hour earlier today.
"All other services were up and running as usual during this time however we apologise to those customers that were impacted.  We are currently investigating what caused this to prevent it happening again."
Response list: ['A major UK bank has been fined £56m for a system crash that caused problems for customers.']

Input: The five worshippers alleged they were segregated from the main prayer hall as they could not observe the custom of sitting cross-legged on the floor.
One woman said the screening felt like a "prison". Members accused the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara of discrimination.
A settlement was reached and the screens had already come down, the gurdwara said.
See more stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country here
The terms of the settlement were approved during a hearing at Birmingham County Court on Monday.
Bosses of the gurdwara have agreed to remove all partitions within weeks and will install a lift to the first floor prayer room.
The five claimants included Bhupinder Kaur Chohan.
She said: "The screening was like you were in a prison. On one side you've done something wrong; people [will] catch what you've got. That's how we felt."
Malkit Singh, who has cerebral palsy, said the segregation had been "very hard" and had "upset" him.
Rajinder Singh Basi, chair of Sikh Forum Wolverhampton, described the result as a "victory".
"Disabled people are not second class citizens and deserve enjoyment of the same right to worship and attend gurdwaras as everyone else," he said.
"Now the gurdwara must make changes and we look forward to them doing so," Mr Basi added.
A statement on behalf of the gurdwara said: "In reaching this amicable settlement, the gurdwara would want to send the message that all are welcome with open hands and that the gurdwara would continue to address the needs of the aged, frail and the disabled in accordance with the guidance provided by Sikh Council UK."
Response list: ['A Sikh gurdwara in Birmingham has settled a dispute over segregation of disabled worshippers.']
Ground truth: Screens separating disabled people from other worshippers at a Sikh gurdwara in Wolverhampton will be removed after a court case was settled.

Input: As they prepare to go to the polls on Sunday for the second time in six months, only 3% put the need for a new administration among the country's top-priority issues, according to public pollster CIS.
The four main parties failed to reach a deal after December's inconclusive vote and there is little sign that things will change.
For Spaniards, though, a 21% rate of unemployment unsurprisingly remains the main concern.
There are signs that economic confidence is recovering as Spain emerges from the 2008-2013 double-dip recession known here as "la crisis".
First-quarter figures for 2016 show GDP growth of 0.8%, the same as during the second half of last year, mainly thanks to a 0.9% rise in consumer spending.

King calls new vote amid deadlock
Spain's 'usual suspects' line up for fresh poll
Podemos bangs on doors of power
They may embrace this partial economic recovery but Spain's voters are not crediting the conservative Popular Party (PP), which claims to have brought it about.
The PP, now a caretaker government, saw its support plummet from 45% at the height of the 2011 election to 29% on 20 December 2015.
It was enough to finish first but not to secure majority support. In the subsequent four-month lifetime of modern Spain's shortest parliament, the second-placed Socialists (PSOE) ruled out a grand coalition with the PP while negotiating a deal with the fourth-largest party, Ciudadanos (Citizens).
But repeat elections were inevitable when third-placed anti-austerity party Podemos refused to approve the deal.

Opinion polls suggests little is likely to change on 26 June, although Podemos is now eyeing second place ahead of the Socialists, largely because of a coalition deal with the United Left, an amalgam of communists and other leftists.
In Sunday's Metroscopia poll published by newspaper El Pais, the PP led on 29%, Unidos Podemos had 26%, PSOE 20.5% and Ciudadanos 14.5%.
Who would make deals with whom to form a majority was a big question for the only TV debate this month ahead of the vote.
But while all four leaders were adamant they understood that Spanish patience had worn thin, they gave little away.
So with only a month of negotiating time available before Spain's traditional summer shutdown period in August, the prospect of a lost year in politics looms ever larger.
Belgium's record of 541 days without a renewed government may still be a way off, but the brinkmanship of Spanish politicians could have disastrous consequences.
"It does look like no-one wants to make a deal with anyone," says Pablo Simon, a politics professor at Madrid's Carlos III University. "But I think this is basically down to electoral strategy because all the parties accept that there simply cannot be another election."
Mr Simon argues that decisions are needed to prevent a drop in public investment and to incorporate new spending cuts demanded by the European Commission into the 2016 budget, hurriedly passed by the PP in parliament last autumn.
According to the president of Seopan, which represents Spain's construction industry, the building sector is heading towards a ninth successive year in crisis on the evidence of the first quarter of the year without a government.
"Investment in construction and infrastructure will fall by between 15% and 18% in 2016," Julian Nunez told a conference in Santander last week.
Beyond the delicate economic circumstances, Mr Simon also warns of the dangerous potential for political disaffection if urgently needed reforms to boost employment, improve education and crack down on corruption are not forthcoming.
"If the current blockage continues and the economic situation and inequality worsen, we could reach a point where we find that Spain is not immune to the emergence of the far right," he says, noting that only Spain, Portugal and Ireland have so far been unaffected by the rise of extremist politics among European nations this century.
Popular Party Acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said the party with the most seats in Congress should be allowed to govern. His PP will again propose a broad coalition with PSOE and Ciudadanos. But the Socialists are not interested and Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera says Mr Rajoy should step aside first because of the string of PP corruption scandals that emerged while he has been leader.
Socialists Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez risks a shocking reverse if his historical party of the left is surpassed by Podemos. Polls suggest that together, Unidos Podemos and PSOE may scrape a majority or come very close. But Mr Sanchez and Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias have become bitter political enemies after the latter effectively dynamited any chance of an understanding earlier this year by insisting on an independence referendum in Catalonia, anathema to the Socialists. Mr Sanchez may have an unpalatable choice to make: be the junior partner in coalition with Unidos Podemos or allow the PP to stay in power.
Unidos Podemos The left-wing coalition wants an end to austerity politics and a massive investment in public services, as well as a minimum income guarantee for all households. This would be funded by significant tax rises for the rich and for companies. However, Mr Iglesias has hinted that a Catalonia referendum might not be a red line, a shift that would pile pressure on the Socialists to join a coalition.
Ciudadanos The anti-corruption centrist party has signed regional deals with both the PSOE and PP at a regional level, in return for a commitment to greater transparency. And leader Albert Rivera's February deal with Pedro Sanchez was a coup for Ciudadanos. But if the Socialists fade further in the polls, Mr Rivera may feel he is better served pushing for a deal with the PP, without Rajoy at its head.
Response list: ["Spain's voters are not ready to face the consequences of a second election, according to a poll."]
Ground truth: Spaniards appear to have grown used to the idea of not having a government.

Input: The Super Eagles landed in Zambia barely 22 hours before their 2018 World Cup qualifier on 9 October after financial problems delayed the squad.
Nigeria, captained by Mikel, won Olympic bronze despite arriving just hours before their first match in Manaus because of transport issues.
"I don't think anything can beat the problems that we faced at the Olympics. I don't think any team or country can go through what we went through in Brazil and perform the way we did," Mikel told BBC Sport.
"I think it's a miracle [their unorthodox journey to Olympic football bronze] and I don't think it will ever happen again.
"To arrive at a tournament a couple of hours before your first game and still end up with a medal was an outstanding team performance.
"I wouldn't say it's the same problem [arriving on match day] we are facing now, but it is still the same issues that need to be sorted out," said Mikel.
Three-time African champions Nigeria are top of Group B in their qualifying race for Russia after a hard-fought 2-1 win in Zambia.
But Mikel, who made a scoring debut for his country at the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations against Zimbabwe, believes hitch-free preparations will boost their chances of clinching the group's sole ticket.
"For us to succeed we need to put things in place as early as possible and let the players focus on football, and not dealing with issues like flight and other things off the pitch," he said.
"This is where my experience comes in and make sure I keep the team together. I don't let whatever is happening outside distract the team," Mikel added.
Pay rows have often surrounded Nigerian teams with players boycotting training at major tournaments over unpaid bonuses.
As the most experienced player in the current squad with 72 appearances, Mikel is keen to avert such an embarrassing situation.
"I try to take in all the problems, I deal with it myself and I only speak to the players when there is good news.
"I'm sure that's what they always want to hear from me, I listen to them, we make decisions together - at the end of the day I have to have a final say on what we have to do.
"Sometimes you only need one voice, with a single voice I think everything goes smoothly.
"With the experience that I have, I will make sure whatever is happening off the pitch doesn't affect us in these qualifiers."
Olympic bronze medallist winner, Mikel has played for Nigeria at four Africa Cup of Nations tournaments in 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2013.
He won the 2013 Nations Cup title in South Africa and was a member of the team that reached the second round at the 2014 World Cup.

Input: The education, health, home affairs and business committee chairmen want PSHE, which covers sex education, made statutory in primaries and secondaries.
In a letter to Nicky Morgan, they express concern at her failure to respond to various committees' calls.
The government is working on a way to achieve high-quality PSHE for all.
It published guidelines on sex and relationship education (SRE) in 2015.
While PSHE education is not part of the statutory national curriculum, which means there is no national programme of study for the subject, the Department for Education say schools should teach it to pupils.
Schools are also required to have a policy on sex and relationship education which is made available to parents, and for inspection, which must set out how this is provided, monitored and evaluated..
It must also include information about parents' right to withdraw their children from sex education classes.
The chairmen's letter said: "We write to express our disappointment with your response so far to the issue of the statutory status for PSHE and sex and relationships education in schools.
"PSHE is a crucial part of preparing young people for life. It can provide them with the knowledge and confidence to make decisions which affect their health, well-being and relationships, now and in the future.
"It can develop the skills and attributes needed to secure employment and can help protect young people from abuse in many forms."
In February 2015, the education committee called for the DfE to "develop a work plan for introducing age-appropriate PSHE and SRE as statutory subjects in primary and secondary schools, setting out its strategy for improving the supply of teachers able to deliver this subject and a timetable for achieving this".
In January 2015, the Joint Committee on Human Rights said it would be better if schools were "required broadly to teach the same curriculum in PSHE" and that this should include issues in relation to violence against women and girls.
Six months earlier, the Home Affairs Committee called for PSHE, covering education about female genital mutilation in high prevalence areas, to be made compulsory.
And both the Children's Commissioner for England and the Chief Medical Officer made their own calls to make the subject statutory.
A Department for Education spokesman said it wanted all young people to leave school equipped with a curriculum for life that prepares them to succeed in modern Britain and the teaching of PSHE was central to that plan.
"We are working with head teachers and other experts to understand how best to achieve high-quality PSHE for every pupil," he said.
The spokesman added that PSHE was not yet good enough in many schools, adding the department had committed to looking further at this issue and examining all the options to ensure the subject was taught to a high standard in all schools.
It intended to make significant progress on this issue this Parliament, he said.
Response list: ['Schools are to be required to teach sex and relationship education (SRE) as a statutory subject, a committee has said.']
Ground truth: Four key Commons committees are asking the education secretary to make Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education compulsory in schools.

Input: The comedian and actor had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Reports said he was 52.
Colleagues and peers used Twitter to praise the St Kitts-born Londoner, with comedian David Baddiel mourning a "real loss to comedy".
He came to prominence in the flagship black comedy The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company.
Fellow comedian Sean Hughes wrote on Twitter: "So so sad to hear about the truly wonderful Felix Dexter passing away.
"I hope you can feel the love in the comedy community fella. Rip."
Bill Bailey wrote: "Very sad news about my old friend Felix Dexter. A brilliant comedian, a superb comic actor, a lovely man I feel privileged to have known."
Once named Time Out comedian of the year, Dexter also featured in iconic BBC comedies The Fast Show and Absolutely Fabulous.
More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan.
His close friend, BBC Radio London presenter Eddie Nestor - who acted alongside Dexter for three years in The Real McCoy - told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It's a sad day. It's a really sad day. I went to see him and we talked and we laughed, and we laughed really hard.
"This is somebody who's been diagnosed with a terminal illness and you find yourself laughing really hard, belly laughs."
He added: "We've lost a talented, intelligent, articulate performer who could touch - who could reach out."
The Fast Show's Paul Whitehouse acted with Dexter in Bellamy's People.
Whitehouse told BBC Radio 5 live he was privileged to be close to the comedian and actor.
"He was a very modest, a very private man," he said.
"It was an honour to be close to him.
"He stuck in people's minds, Felix. There's been such an outpouring of warmth and affection for him."
Before entering comedy, Dexter studied law - something he said helped him deal with hecklers.
He named Billy Connolly and the late American comics Richard Pryor and Bill Hicks among his influences, and remained on the stand-up circuit throughout his career.
Later he featured in long-running staples Have I Got News For You and Grumpy Old Men, as well as the influential Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge.
As an actor, he had parts in Casualty and The Bill and appeared in the West End alongside Christian Slater.

Input: A local official said many of those who died had been in the market in Bodo. At least three suicide bombers were said to be involved.
The Nigeria-based militant group Boko Haram is suspected of carrying out the attack.
Last month, two female suicide bombers blew themselves up in Bodo.
Cameroon is part of a regional coalition fighting Boko Haram, along with Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Benin.
Although the militants have been driven from most of the areas they controlled in north-eastern Nigeria, they have continued to carry out suicide bombings and raids into neighbouring countries.
One witness in Bodo told the BBC that at least two of the attackers were teenage girls who had hidden their explosives in sacks of grain.
Another witness said two blasts had hit the market and another had targeted a roadblock.
"We were in the market [at] around 10 in the morning when we heard a blast. The second one went off not more than two minutes after and we took to our heels," the witness said.
"There is a vigilante roadblock just outside town where another bomb went off and killed six people."

Input: First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness asked the Northern Ireland Assembly speaker to "convene a special sitting".
The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was set up to encourage people to use green fuels to produce heat.
But serious flaws meant the scheme went far beyond its budget.
It paid out subsidies that were greater than the cost of the fuels used in the heating systems, allowing claimants could earn more cash the more fuel they burned.
In a joint statement, Mrs Foster and Mr McGuinness said they wanted MLAs to return to Stormont.
"This will facilitate a full statement to be made by the first minister to members on the matters of public concern relating to RHI," they added.
"RHI was discussed by the executive today and ministers around the table underlined the seriousness of the issues involved and the importance of restoring public confidence."
The ministers reiterated that "detailed plans are being finalised to significantly reduce the projected losses" to the Northern Ireland budget over the next 20 years.
Mrs Foster has faced calls for her to resign over her role in the scheme.
It was set up in 2012 when she was Stormont's enterprise minister, and she was later told about serious flaws in the initiative by a whistleblower, although the concerns were ignored by Deti officials.
Mrs Foster said civil servants did not inform her of any issues arising from the whistleblower's alert.
Earlier on Wednesday, BBC Radio Ulster's The Stephen Nolan Show revealed that she personally fought a decision by another minister to close the scheme.
A senior source she had a "heated conversation" with her DUP colleague Jonathan Bell, the then enterprise minister, over his plan to end the initiative in January.
The scheme then remained open to applications for two weeks.
The DUP said Mr Bell had extended the scheme "following representations, including those from other political parties".
Response list: ["Northern Ireland's ministers have called for a full statement from the first minister to members of the assembly on the problems with the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme."]
Ground truth: MLAs will return to Stormont on Monday for an urgent discussion on public concerns over a botched heat scheme that could cost taxpayers £400m.

Swansea University pro-vice-chancellor Prof Iwan Davies said facilities, including a shop and student's union, would remain in use until students moved to the new campus.
The first phase of its science and innovation campus is currently being built and is expected to be completed by the summer of 2015.
The university estimates it contribute more than Â£3bn to the regional economy over the next 10 years and create thousands of jobs.
Plans include a research and testing facility operated in partnership with Rolls-Royce.
There will also be new teaching and research facilities for the university's engineering, business and economics, maths, and computer science departments as well as student residential accommodation.
Response list: ['A university campus in Swansea has been approved for a £100m redevelopment.']
