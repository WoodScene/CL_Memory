Ground truth: Have you been talking to Russia much?

idx: 3
Response list: ["I'm going to Hol."]
Ground truth: Are you aiming to claim Belgium in year 1? As it is, there's no way for you to get three builds so curious which two you will prioritize.

idx: 4
Response list: ["I haven't heard from either, but I'm sure they are busy."]
Ground truth: I don't really have a good read on Russia to be honest

idx: 5
Response list: ["I'm not sure if I should be."]
Ground truth: So I'm guessing you plan on hitting the Germans then? Need help with that?

Response list: ['I’m going to be in the north, so I’ll be able to support you into Belgium.']
Ground truth: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

Ground truth: Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North

idx: 14
Response list: ["I don't know, I just thought they would be more aggressive."]
Ground truth: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you

idx: 15
Response list: ['I’m doing great.  I hope you are too.']
Ground truth: Hey Austria! How’s it going?
