Ground truth: Have you been talking to Russia much?

idx: 3
Response list: ["I'm going to Hol, if that's alright with you? I'm very interested in your idea of giving me free pass into Belgium for an alliance against England."]
Ground truth: Are you aiming to claim Belgium in year 1? As it is, there's no way for you to get three builds so curious which two you will prioritize.

idx: 4
Response list: ["I haven't, but I hope you'll consider a mutual information sharing pact with me."]
Ground truth: I don't really have a good read on Russia to be honest

idx: 5
Response list: ["I'm not interested in anything, but I'm interested in you not being interested in anything."]
Ground truth: So I'm guessing you plan on hitting the Germans then? Need help with that?

Ground truth: Thanks for the heads up

idx: 7
Response list: ["I've heard Italy is getting more aggressive.  I'm not sure if that's because of Russia or because of Italy.  I've been thinking about splitting the Balkans with you, but I'm not sure if that's the best idea.  I'm not sure if we should be splitting with you.  I'm not sure if we should be splitting with Russia.  I'm not sure if we should be splitting with Italy.  I'm not sure if we should be splitting with anyone.  I'm not sure if we should be splitting with anyone.  I'm not sure if we should be splitting with anyone."]
Ground truth: All I have heard from Italy thus far is they don't want to fight so... hopefully that is the case

Response list: ["I think I'm not going to go for Austria off the bat. I think it's probably going to be the same as before."]
Ground truth: He’s scared of me pulling off a lepanto. What’s the deal for you guys, seems like you and england have an agreement at the very least to stay out of ENG. Did you and germany agree to that bounce in Bur?

idx: 10
Response list: ['I’m not sure about the English Channel, but I think you’ll be fine.']
Ground truth: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

idx: 13
Response list: ["I'm not sure about the timing, but I think the best way to proceed is to move both of your armies to the south. I'll be moving to Livonia and then to the Black sea."]
Ground truth: Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North

idx: 14
Response list: ["I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure you and Germany will have to go for it. I'm not sure about Italy though, but I'm pretty sure you and me will have to go for it."]
Ground truth: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you

idx: 15
Response list: ["I'm not sure yet, but I'm looking forward to the game."]
Ground truth: Hey Austria! How’s it going?
