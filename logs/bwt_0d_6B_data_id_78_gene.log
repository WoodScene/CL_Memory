Pred: I am not sure what you mean by neutral territory.
GT: That's my intent; I was going to ask you to do the same but you beat me to it.

idx: 1
Pred: I am not sure about Turkey, but I think they are a good friend.
GT: Still though, you seem well placed!

idx: 2
Pred: I’m not sure how to respond to that.
GT: Have you been talking to Russia much?

idx: 3
Pred: I think you're right. I'm not sure about Belgium, but I think you're right about Holland.
GT: Are you aiming to claim Belgium in year 1? As it is, there's no way for you to get three builds so curious which two you will prioritize.

idx: 4
Pred: I don't know. I've heard from Russia, but not from Austria.
GT: I don't really have a good read on Russia to be honest

idx: 5
Pred: I'm not sure about that. I'm not sure about that.
GT: So I'm guessing you plan on hitting the Germans then? Need help with that?

idx: 6
Pred: I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
GT: Thanks for the heads up

idx: 7
Pred: I've heard Italy is a bit of a tough nut to crack. I'm not sure if they're an unknown quantity.
GT: All I have heard from Italy thus far is they don't want to fight so... hopefully that is the case

idx: 8
Pred: I'm not sure if I'm going to set up a Lepanto, but I think I'll just go with ION.
GT: If you reeeally want to try a Lepanto, we can go for it lol, but I think we'd stall out a bit too much to make it worthwhile

idx: 9
Pred: I think Turkey is a good move, but I think it's a bit passive.
GT: He’s scared of me pulling off a lepanto. What’s the deal for you guys, seems like you and england have an agreement at the very least to stay out of ENG. Did you and germany agree to that bounce in Bur?

idx: 10
Pred: I think you're getting a bit too much into the game.
GT: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

idx: 11
Pred: I think I meant France.
GT: Am currently speaking to both but haven't really moved towards either as of yet.

What are your plans vis a vis alliances and expansion?

idx: 12
Pred: I'm not sure I'm ready to just hand over Norway and Sweden, unfortunately:
GT: Sounds good to me! Thank you so much for being agreeable. I view Norway as a gesture of goodwill and I will definitely remember it. Hopefully, I will find another way to help you in the future 😃

idx: 13
Pred: I think I'll keep my army in Moscow for now.
GT: Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North

idx: 14
Pred: I don't think so, but I do know that the west is pretty peaceful.
GT: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you

idx: 15
Pred: I think it's great.  I'm not sure about the game, but I'm looking forward to it.
GT: Hey Austria! How’s it going?

GT: Still though, you seem well placed!

idx: 2
Pred: I don't think so. I think it's better to ask how your relationship with France is.
GT: Have you been talking to Russia much?

idx: 3
Pred: I think it's a good idea to move to the south of France, as it's a good place to get some of the other countries to support us. I think it's a good idea to move to the north of France, as it's a good place to get some of the other countries to support us.

GT: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

GT: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you
