Ground truth: That's my intent; I was going to ask you to do the same but you beat me to it.

Response list: ["I'm sure he would be."]
Ground truth: Still though, you seem well placed!

Response list: ['France is a bit of a problem for me right now.']
Ground truth: Have you been talking to Russia much?

idx: 3
Response list: ["I'm going to Hol, if that's alright with you? I'm very interested in your idea of giving me free pass into Belgium for an alliance against England."]
Ground truth: Are you aiming to claim Belgium in year 1? As it is, there's no way for you to get three builds so curious which two you will prioritize.

idx: 4
Response list: ["I've heard from Austria, but not Russia."]
Ground truth: I don't really have a good read on Russia to be honest

idx: 5
Response list: ["I'm not sure what you're talking about."]
Ground truth: So I'm guessing you plan on hitting the Germans then? Need help with that?

idx: 6
Response list: ["I'm sorry to hear that."]
Ground truth: Thanks for the heads up

idx: 7
Response list: ["I haven't heard anything from Italy yet either."]
Ground truth: All I have heard from Italy thus far is they don't want to fight so... hopefully that is the case

idx: 8
Response list: ["I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but I'll definitely let you know if I move to Tun."]
Ground truth: If you reeeally want to try a Lepanto, we can go for it lol, but I think we'd stall out a bit too much to make it worthwhile

idx: 9
Response list: ["I think it's because he's trying to get a foothold in the Balkans."]
Ground truth: He’s scared of me pulling off a lepanto. What’s the deal for you guys, seems like you and england have an agreement at the very least to stay out of ENG. Did you and germany agree to that bounce in Bur?

idx: 10
Response list: ["I think you're going to have to work harder with Germany."]
Ground truth: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

idx: 11
Response list: ['I think you meant France or Austria?']
Ground truth: Am currently speaking to both but haven't really moved towards either as of yet.

What are your plans vis a vis alliances and expansion?

idx: 12
Response list: ["I'm not sure I'm ready to just hand over Norway and Sweden, unfortunately:/"]
Ground truth: Sounds good to me! Thank you so much for being agreeable. I view Norway as a gesture of goodwill and I will definitely remember it. Hopefully, I will find another way to help you in the future 😃

idx: 13
Response list: ["I think I'll move to Livonia and then move to StP in year 2."]
Ground truth: Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North

idx: 14
Response list: ['I think he was trying to get a foothold in the west.']
Ground truth: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you

idx: 15
Response list: ["I hope you're having a great time in the game!"]
Ground truth: Hey Austria! How’s it going?

Response list: ["I'm not sure what you mean by that."]
Ground truth: That's my intent; I was going to ask you to do the same but you beat me to it.

idx: 1
Response list: ["I'm sure he would be too."]
Ground truth: Still though, you seem well placed!

idx: 2
Response list: ['France is a bit of a problem for me right now.']
Ground truth: Have you been talking to Russia much?

idx: 3
Response list: ["I'm going to Hol, if that's alright with you? I'm very interested in your idea of giving me free pass into Belgium for an alliance against England."]
Ground truth: Are you aiming to claim Belgium in year 1? As it is, there's no way for you to get three builds so curious which two you will prioritize.

idx: 4
Response list: ["I've heard from Austria, but not Russia."]
Ground truth: I don't really have a good read on Russia to be honest

idx: 5
Response list: ["I'm not sure what you're talking about."]
Ground truth: So I'm guessing you plan on hitting the Germans then? Need help with that?

idx: 6
Response list: ["I'm sorry to hear that."]
Ground truth: Thanks for the heads up

idx: 7
Response list: ["I haven't heard anything from Italy yet either."]
Ground truth: All I have heard from Italy thus far is they don't want to fight so... hopefully that is the case

idx: 8
Response list: ["I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but I'll definitely let you know if I move to Tun."]
Ground truth: If you reeeally want to try a Lepanto, we can go for it lol, but I think we'd stall out a bit too much to make it worthwhile

idx: 9
Response list: ["I think it's because he's trying to get a foothold in the Balkans."]
Ground truth: He’s scared of me pulling off a lepanto. What’s the deal for you guys, seems like you and england have an agreement at the very least to stay out of ENG. Did you and germany agree to that bounce in Bur?

idx: 10
Response list: ["I think you're going to have to work harder with Germany."]
Ground truth: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

idx: 11
Response list: ['I think you meant France or Austria?']
Ground truth: Am currently speaking to both but haven't really moved towards either as of yet.

What are your plans vis a vis alliances and expansion?

idx: 12
Response list: ["I'm not sure I'm ready to just hand over Norway and Sweden, unfortunately:/"]
Ground truth: Sounds good to me! Thank you so much for being agreeable. I view Norway as a gesture of goodwill and I will definitely remember it. Hopefully, I will find another way to help you in the future 😃

idx: 13
Response list: ["I think I'll move to Livonia and then move to StP in year 2."]
Ground truth: Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North

idx: 14
Response list: ['I think he was trying to get a foothold in the west.']
Ground truth: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you

idx: 15
Response list: ["I hope you're having a great time in the game!"]
Ground truth: Hey Austria! How’s it going?
