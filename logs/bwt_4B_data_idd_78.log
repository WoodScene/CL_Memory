Response list: ["I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can get along well with the rest of the players. I'm not sure about the alliance idea yet, but I'm definitely interested in getting to know you better."]
Ground truth: Are you aiming to claim Belgium in year 1? As it is, there's no way for you to get three builds so curious which two you will prioritize.

idx: 4
Response list: ["I haven't heard from Austria, but I have heard from Russia. They are going to send a force to the south."]
Ground truth: I don't really have a good read on Russia to be honest

idx: 5
Response list: ['I think I have a plan to get you out of the Netherlands.']
Ground truth: So I'm guessing you plan on hitting the Germans then? Need help with that?

idx: 6
Response list: ["I was talking with Russia, negotiating over Norway and such. They told me they were planning on attacking you, as they thought I was there ally. The truth is, I really don't want to see russia run off with this game, so I decided to let you know."]

Ground truth: All I have heard from Italy thus far is they don't want to fight so... hopefully that is the case

Response list: ["I think it's because they are trying to get a foothold in the Balkans."]
Ground truth: He’s scared of me pulling off a lepanto. What’s the deal for you guys, seems like you and england have an agreement at the very least to stay out of ENG. Did you and germany agree to that bounce in Bur?

idx: 10
Response list: ['I think I can trust you. I will go with your plan.']
Ground truth: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

idx: 11
Response list: ['I think I meant France or Austria?']
Ground truth: Am currently speaking to both but haven't really moved towards either as of yet.

What are your plans vis a vis alliances and expansion?

idx: 12

Ground truth: Sounds good to me! Thank you so much for being agreeable. I view Norway as a gesture of goodwill and I will definitely remember it. Hopefully, I will find another way to help you in the future 😃

idx: 13
Response list: ['I think I will move my army in Moscow to Warsaw.']
Ground truth: Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North

idx: 14
Response list: ['I think he is trying to get a foothold in the west.']
Ground truth: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you

idx: 15
Response list: ['I hope so.  I think that would be great.  I think that would be a good start.']
Ground truth: Hey Austria! How’s it going?

I'm not sure if that's the right way to put it, but I'm not a newbie.  I'm more of a veteran.  I'm not sure if that's the right way to put it, but I'm not a newbie."]
Ground truth: Still though, you seem well placed!

idx: 2
Response list: ["I'm not sure about that. I think I need to be careful with France. I don't want to get into a war with them."]
Ground truth: Have you been talking to Russia much?

idx: 3
Response list: ["I think I'll go to Holland. I'm not sure about the alliance yet, but I'm interested in your idea."]
Ground truth: Are you aiming to claim Belgium in year 1? As it is, there's no way for you to get three builds so curious which two you will prioritize.

idx: 4
Response list: ["I haven't heard from Austria, but I have heard from Russia. They're going to send a Moscow north."]
Ground truth: I don't really have a good read on Russia to be honest

idx: 5
Response list: ["You're welcome. I'm glad you're not going to attack me. I'm not going to attack you either. I'm just going to try to get the best of you."]
Ground truth: So I'm guessing you plan on hitting the Germans then? Need help with that?

idx: 6
Response list: ["I see, so I guess I should be on my guard then. I'm not sure if I can trust Russia, but I'm not sure if I can trust you either."]
Ground truth: Thanks for the heads up

idx: 7
Response list: ["I haven't heard from Italy yet. I think they're going to be a bit of a problem. I think they're going to be a bit of a problem. I think they're going to be a bit of a problem."]

idx: 8
Response list: ["I think I'll just move to ION and then see how it goes. I don't think I'll be moving to Tun."]
Ground truth: If you reeeally want to try a Lepanto, we can go for it lol, but I think we'd stall out a bit too much to make it worthwhile

idx: 9
Response list: ["I think it's because he's trying to get a foothold in the Balkans."]
Ground truth: He’s scared of me pulling off a lepanto. What’s the deal for you guys, seems like you and england have an agreement at the very least to stay out of ENG. Did you and germany agree to that bounce in Bur?

idx: 10
Response list: ["I think I can get them to not move there. I just need to make sure that I don't get too close to them."]
Ground truth: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

idx: 11
Response list: ['I think I meant France or Austria?']
Ground truth: Am currently speaking to both but haven't really moved towards either as of yet.

What are your plans vis a vis alliances and expansion?

idx: 12
Response list: ["I think that's a good deal. I'll take Norway and Sweden."]
Ground truth: Sounds good to me! Thank you so much for being agreeable. I view Norway as a gesture of goodwill and I will definitely remember it. Hopefully, I will find another way to help you in the future 😃

idx: 13
Response list: ["I think I'll move to St. Petersburg and Sevastopol. I'll also move to the south to secure my position."]
Ground truth: Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North

idx: 14
Response list: ["I think he's going to go for the Mediterranean, but I'm not sure."]
Ground truth: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you

idx: 15
Response list: ["I think that's a great idea.  I'm excited to see what happens."]
Ground truth: Hey Austria! How’s it going?
