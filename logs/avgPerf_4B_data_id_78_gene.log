Ground truth: Are you aiming to claim Belgium in year 1? As it is, there's no way for you to get three builds so curious which two you will prioritize.

idx: 4
Response list: ["I haven't heard from Austria, but I have heard from Russia. They are going to send A to the south, I believe."]
Ground truth: I don't really have a good read on Russia to be honest

idx: 10
Response list: ['I think I can trust you. I will keep my word.']
Ground truth: Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. 
Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

idx: 13
Response list: ["I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to moving my armies yet, but I'm definitely interested in a group effort against the British."]
Ground truth: Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North

idx: 14
Response list: ["I think he's trying to get up to speed before the next round"]
Ground truth: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you

Response list: ["I'm going to Belgium, and I'm really interested in talking to you about an alliance against England. I'm not sure what you'd be interested in, but I'm definitely interested in keeping the peace with the Netherlands."]

Since they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce

Response list: ["I think he's going to go army in Bre and then build a fleet to support a CONQUEST of Britain. I think we should build up against him."]
Ground truth: Yes—he said he wanted to get support to belgium... but he could have done this with a fleet as well, so I think it may have been an aggresive move(even though he insists we are still allies)... and for this reason I'm going to tell you that he said he was planning on attacking you, although not completely full fledged(the fleet in spain and the army in mar). Just a fair warning, and since it seems like you don't have your hands too full over there maybe start worrieng about france? UP to you
